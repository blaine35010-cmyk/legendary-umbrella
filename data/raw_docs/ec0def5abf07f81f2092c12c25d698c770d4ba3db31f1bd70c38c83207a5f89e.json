DR-2023-900051.01\nBRITTANY MICHELLE GILLILAND )\nDEFENDANT/PETITIONER )\nRESPONSE TO MOTHER’S OBJECTION TO FATHER’S MOTION FOR CONTEMPT\nAND MOTION TO HOLD FATHER IN CONTEMPT\nComes now the Respondent/Father, Christopher Blaine McGregor, by and through his\nattorney of record, Dianne James Davis, and files this his Response to Mother’s Objection to\nFather’s Motion for Contempt and Motion to Hold Father in Contempt, and would state as\nfollows:\n1. That Father’s Counsel only received notice that the Mother intended to “pick up AK\nfor her visitation” via email received at 10:59 am July 14, 2025.\n2. That in Mother’s Exhibit “A”, a text between the Mother and Father, the Father\nrelayed that A.K. said “she’s not ready for that”. When the parents met for drop off of\nB.M., the Mother did not get out of the car and make any attempt to speak of A.K.\neven though, in the text, the Father stated “You are more than welcome to have a\nconversation with AK during drop off today”.\n3. The minor child, A.K., is in therapy and due to her past history with her Mother, as\nthis Court has heard in the past, is not ready to have a one on one relationship with\nher.\n4. That it is the Mother’s responsibility to attend the Sunday Dinners, take time to speak\nto the minor child when she is able to attend the child’s events, and take time to speak\nto the minor child at drop off in order to build trust in a relationship. That as the\nminor child stated in her text in Exhibit “C” in the Father’s filing “She never got out\nof the car and spoke with me yesterday, never congratulated me for doing good at\ncheer camp, so what changed now? I don’t wanna call her because she’s not\nDOCUMENT 212\ngonna really listen to me, she’s basically gonna be talking to herself because any\ntime I tell her how I feel, she always makes it about her”. The Father believes the\nMother should be concerned about building a relationship with A.K. by listening to\nher concerns and congratulating her on her accomplishments rather than asserting her\nrights. In this same Text, the Father told A.K. “We are both proud of you” as he is\nnot attempting to alienate A.K. from her Mother.\n5. That the Mother’s marriage was void as she married during the appeal of the divorce,\nso it is unknown to the Father if there are actually step-siblings involved. The\nMother’s concern should be establishing a relationship with A.K. first before\nattempting to cultivate a relationship with any possible step-siblings.\n6. That the Father is making every possible attempt to keep the minor child, A.K. safe\nand in a good place mentally.\nWHEREFORE, the premises considered, the Father respectfully requests this Court to find that\nhe is NOT in contempt of this Court for withholding the minor child, A.K. from the Mother and any\nfurther relief he is entitled.\nRespectfully submitted on this the 15th day of July, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, Alabama 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (Facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing in the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 15th day of July, 2025.\nBarbara H.
