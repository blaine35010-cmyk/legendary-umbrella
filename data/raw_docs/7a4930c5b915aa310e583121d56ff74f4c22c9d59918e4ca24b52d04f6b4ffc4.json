I know that she' s lost it\n22 for over a month before . I know that she' s got it\n23 back early, but I don ' t know who took it away in\n24 the beginning is what I ' m trying to get to.\n25 Probably sometimes Brittany might have took i t\nBrooke E.

When we had\n9 Bennett, he was even upset that Bennett was a boy.\n10 He wanted him to be a girl, and when we had our\n11 gende r reveal, he was reall y upset about that for a\n12 really long time, tryi ng to cope with having a boy.\n13 He said he's a better girl dad, but since then,\n14 when I would handle Bennett, you know, it was\n15 always, ''Well, you do more fo:r Bennett than you do\n16 for Addie Kate.\" And it was kind of brought up to\n17 her, you know, so it was a -- I guess , not tension\n18 between t hat , between the two children, and I l ove\n19 my chil dren equal~y. I mean, I have my daughter\n20 and I have my son, you know . It ' s like\n21 picture-perfect .\n22 Q, Well, did it -- as Addie Kate got t o be six,\n23 seven, eight years old, that's whe n Bennett was born?\n24 A. 'rhat ' s co.rrect.\n25 Q. Is that right'?\nBrooke E. Head, AL-C~ No. 656\nO£ficial Court Reporter\nState ot Al.abama\n164\n5th Judicia1 Circuit\n1 A, Yes. She turned seven two weeks after he was\n2 born.\n3 Q.

I\n8 would ask about it. It woul d get addressed. If I\n9 took her phone, then that was an issue. She went\n10 to her dad at that point.\n11 Q.

I 'm sorry. I don ' t even r ecal l what it was\n8 about. There was a lot of instances where I felt\n9 as though I breathed funny, and he didn't like it.\n10 He was very stressed.\n11 Q. Were there any other times where he physically\n12 hit you, either with something or with his fist or\n13 slapped'?\n14 A. Yes. He's shoved me . He shoved me.

We had went into Addie Kate ' s room\n23 because I was going to get the kids, a nd I was\n24 going to go to t he hospital. I came out of Addie\n25 Kate ' s room and sat down on the couch, and he sat\nBrooke E.

Blaine didn ' t\n18 want Sam. When he bought Sam for Addie Kate, he\n19 decided he didn ' t want hi m because he was pooping\n20 in the f loor. We had just bought our house on\n21 Dobbs, and I had contacted his mother, and I said,\n22 \"Please tell him not to give Sam away.\" And he\n23 didn ' t . He decided not t o, you know, give him\n24 away. We did get Bailey for Addie Kate . That was\n25 kind of to get her to -- to get her to sleep in her\nBrooke E. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\n0££icial.

Were both those dogs bought for Addie Kate?\n6 A. Yes, they were.\n7 Q. Has that been sort of the pattern of Blaine\n8 regarding buying gifts for Addie Kate?\n9 A. That ' s another thing wi th the difference\n10 between Addie Kate and Bennett. There ' s - - large\n11 purchases have always been, you know, for Addie\n12 Kate.

You had had one\n7 since June, so that was not true; isn ' t that correct?\n8 A. We had a joint account. There was nothing i n\n9 there, though . That was a j oint . I ' m not going t o\n10 use something with\n11 Q. Well , all I ' m saying i s , is that he would not l et\n12 you even have a bank account , would not let you have\n13 one?\n14 A. I mean, I don 1 t have money to get an account .\n15 Q. I ' m not talking about money to have it.

That\n6 mischaracterizes all the testimony, a nd i t 's\n7 hearsay, and it calls for the mental state of\n8 a child.\n9 MR. YOUNG: Judge?\n10 Q. (By Mr. Young) I mean, I can ask you this. Do\n11 you think she ' s scared of you?\n12 A. I think she i s now because of your cl ient and\n13 his family.\n14 Q.

Do you know why your daughter would describe the\n1 force that you used to pl ace those marks on her arm\n8 to this Court if it didn ' t happen?\n9 A. I think t hat she was taught.

She\n3 said that correctly.\n4 Q. And this Court is very ski lled at asking, and if\n5 she said she was in there and saw all thi s go on,\n6 would she be wrong about t hat?\n7 A. If she said that s he saw it happen, then, yes,\n8 she would be wrong .\ng Q. Now, you had clai med that you don ' t know anything\n10 about the taxes that have been filed for you in 2021?\n11 A.

You contend that - - on the cell phone, and\n15 you went and deleted messages , talked to her, and\n16 took her phone away, but Blaine was the one that gave\n17 it back to her? Not you? Was that what you ' r e\n18 telling the Court?\n19 A. Blaine would always gi ve her her phone back .\n20 There were times that she woul d not have it for,\n21 you know, a couple of days , but normall y, he would\n22 give it back to her . He would be the one.\n23 Q. You say normally, but sometimes, you give it back\n24 to her?\n25 A. Wit h an appropriate amount of t i me away from\nBrooke E.

Brittany -- I received a phone call from\n1.2 Brittany . I don ' t know the exact date . Sometime\n13 before all of this took place. I guess soon, like,\n14 close to the date, and I did receive a phone call\n15 f rom her, yes, sir, that asked me if I had ever\n16 popped my child in the mouth, and by that, I\n17 elaborated and said, \"If you just mean a litt le,\n18 you know, \"stop talking to me that way\" slight pop\n19 in the mouth, nothing to hurt her, then yes, I\n20 have .\" And I know that Brittany -- I don ' t want to\n21 put verbiage i n somebody ' s mouth, but you know --\n22 \"Okay.

I just know that\n2 so she asked me if I had ever popped Brooklyn in\n3 the mouth, and I s a id , \" Yes , I have . \" And I\n4 remember, again, not putting exact verbiage in\n5 somebody' s mouth, but Blaine had made the statement\n6 somewhere along the way of, \"That ' s fine . Porcsha\n7 can discipline he r children how she wants to, but\n8 you ' re not going to slap my child i n the face. \"\n9 And I then spoke up and said, \" I did not say I had\n10 ever slapped my child in the f ace . I do not agree\n11 with that . I have l i ghtly popped her in the mouth,\n12 and that was the extent of it.\"\n13 Q. Okay. Let me ask you . On October 23rd, wh i ch\n14 hasn ' t been that l ong ago .\n15 A. Yeah.\n16 Q. Di d you get a cal l from Blaine because Britt any\n17 didn ' t have a place to stay? Did he as k you about\n18 that?\n19 A. So he sent me a t ext message . I think he\n20 might have t ried to cal l me , and I mi ssed the phone\n21 call, and he did send me a text message, and it\n22 said -- asked me along the lines of if I knew if\n23 Brittany had somewher e to go because he was afrai d\n24 t hat she may be sleeping in her car, and I don •t\n25 remember i f I didn ' t see hi s text until later or\nBrooke F.

I\n2 did not reply to him until later on, next morning,\n3 whatever it was , but I did reach out to Brittany\n4 after that to be sure that she did have somewhere\n5 to go.\n6 Q. Because what ' s interesting about it to me,\n7 Porcsha, is this house she allegedly lives in, is\n8 actual ly your mom' s house?\n9 A. It is my mother ' s home, yes, sir.\n10 Q. That ' s right , so you didn ' t know, at t hat point,\n11 enough to confirm to Blaine that she was staying at\n12 that house?\n13 A. So if I can elaborate, my mother is a travel\n14 nurse, and she has allowed Brittany to have that\n15 home , you know, until everything is figured out,\n16 and my mother and a friend of he.i::s had come home\n17 £:rom a t r ip, and she had said that h er and the\n18 friend of hers would need her home for that night ,\n19 you know, :Oecause my mom does live with her\n20 boyfriend some back and f orth, too.

They ' re just l e tting her stay there, so when t hey\n4 come back into town, Brittany doesn't have a place to\n5 stay':\n6 A. So, she does. My mom does -- I hate to say\n7 s he lives with her boyfriend, pretty much . She has\n8 her home, but, I mean, she l ives with her boy~riend\n9 most of the t i me . This particular night, a friend\n10 of hers , they had come back from a cr uise, and she\n11 had told -- my mom had told her they could\n12 occupy -- now, t his crui se has been in place since\n13 last year, like, long before any of this happened.\n14 Q. Yeah .\n15 A. So these were prior arr a ngements for my mom's\n16 friend to stay in this home, whi ch i s the only\n17 reason t hat Brittany left t he home that night.\n18 Q. Okay, so the only thing I'm going t o ask you\n19 then --\n20 A. Okay, yeah .\n21 Q. So her availability, meaning the availabili ty o f\n22 the home to Brittany, is really subject to whether\n23 your mother is in town and needs i t; is that fair?\n24 A. No, sir . It is availabl e t o Brittany at all\n25 times because my mom has her boyfriend' s house that\nBrooke F. HeaQ, Ali-CCR No. 656\nO£ficial Court Report6r\nState of Alabama\n222\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 they stay at also, but like I said, this trip, the\n2 arrangement for my mom' s friend, when they come\n3 home from the trip to stay here have been in place\n4 like a year prior, I mean, long before she knew\n5 Bri ttany would need her home . Now, my mom will\n6 potentially need to pop in and out to, you know\n7 I mean, because her things are still there also,\n8 but s he does not have to live in that home . She\n9 has somewhere else to live and this home be for\n10 Brittany, yes .\n11 Q. All this furniture that Mr . Radney showed me in\n12 these pictures are your mom ' s furni ture, isn' t it?\n13 A. I t is.\n14 Q. Okay. I' m going to ask you to look at - -\n15 A. Okay.\n16 Q. All right. Now, would you believe -- do you\n17 believe or would be your opinion that somebody t hat\n18 has the ability to do that to their chi ld ought to\n19 have custody or even visitation of this child? Just\n20 say, in general .\n21 A. Yeah, I mean -- ki nd of my perspecti ve is I\n22 don ' t agree with those photos if they did happen,\n23 yes , sir .\n24 Q. Okay, and I ' m not asking you that .\n25 A. I know. I know .\nBrooke \"J!. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\n0££icia1 Col.U\"t Reporter\nState of Alabama\n223\n5th Judiciai Circuit\n1 Q.

Like I said, the only\n12 reason it wasn ' t availabl e to her that night is\n13 because that arrangement with my mot her and her\n14 f riend were in place prior to her offering up the\n15 home to Brittany .
