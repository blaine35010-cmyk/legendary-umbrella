DR-2023-900051.01\n)\nBRITTANY MICHELLE GILLILAND )\nDEFENDANT/PETITIONER )\nMOTION TO SUSPEND WEEKLY DINNERS AND FOR CONTEMPT\nComes now the Plaintiff/Father, Christopher Blaine McGregor, by and through his\nattorney of record, Dianne James Davis, and files this Motion to Suspend Weekly Dinners and\nfor Contempt and would show the Court the following:\nCOUNT I\n1) That a show cause hearing was held on the 31st day of July, 2024, on the\nDefendant’s/Mother’s Petition for Contempt and the Plaintiff’s/Father’s\nCounterclaim for Contempt and the Court entered an Order on November 6, 2024,\nwhich states as follows:\n6. Weekly Family Dinners: Beginning immediately, the Parties\nshall attend weekly dinners together, including the Mother, Father,\nA.K., and the Parties’ minor son. These dinners shall take place\nevery Wednesday evening at 6:30 pm CST. These Wednesday\nevening dinners shall take priority over all other events and\nshall only be cancelled in case of emergency. If the Wednesday\nnight dinner is cancelled, the Parties shall have a “make-up”\ndinner the following day.\n2. Reunification Therapy: Effective immediately, Mother and\nA.K. shall begin attending joint counseling/therapy sessions with\nKelly Turner, a specialist in reunification therapy. Upon the\ntherapist submitting her reunification report to the Court, A.K.\nand Mother shall continue to see Ms. Turner, provided no\nethical conflicts exist, until Mother feels that reunification\ncounseling is no longer necessary.\n2) That pursuant to a subsequent Order of the Court, entered on November 7, 2024,\nthe nightly dinners were permitted to be rescheduled to either Tuesday or\nDOCUMENT 117\nThursday, if the Wednesday night dinner conflicted with one of the minor child’s\npre-scheduled activities.\n3) That the minor child at issue, namely: A.K., dob: 05/24/2012, is actively\ninvolved in school, Beta Club, cheerleading, soccer, and gymnastics.\n4) That the Mother has repeatedly caused scenes during these dinners, requiring law\nenforcement to be called to these “dinners”.\n5) That these “dinners” have become a source of trauma for the children.\n6) That the Mother’s erratic behavior are such that these times as a family unit have\nresulted in hostility and conflict.\n7) That the purpose of these dinners-to foster a positive family environment-is\ncompletely thwarted by the Mother’s inability to control her emotions to the point\nthat it is harming the child.\nWherefore, the premises considered, the Plaintiff/Father respectfully requests that\nthe weekly dinners be suspended and that the Defendant/Mother be ordered to undergo\ncounseling prior to any further attempts at family dinners.\nCOUNT II\n1) That in an attempt to work with the Mother, the Father has allowed her to\nschedule the reunification counseling.\n2) That the Father has provided the Mother with a calendar detailing the child’s\nscheduled activities in an effort to accommodate her.\n3) That on one occasion, the Mother informed the minor child that she would not be\nallowed to cheer at the final game of the season due to a counseling session that\nhad been scheduled, causing this twelve (12) year old child significant distress.\nThe following morning, the Father received an email from the counselor\ninforming him that the counseling session had been cancelled. To the Father’s\ninformation and belief, the Mother knew all along that she would be out of town\nfor work and had no intention of attending the counseling session well before it\nhad been cancelled.\n4) That the Mother scheduled a counseling appointment for December 23, 2024,\nrequiring the Father and minor child to leave a family gathering to attend, only for\nDOCUMENT 117\nthem to arrive and find no one at the counselor’s office. It was later discovered\nthat the appointment had been cancelled with the Mother full knowledge.\n5) That the minor child has expressed great displeasure with the counselor, reporting\nto the Father that the counselor stated “she didn’t believe the child”.\n6) That the counselor has now removed herself from providing services to the\nMother and minor child in this matter.\n7) That the minor child is currently attending counseling sessions with CAC services\nand to the Father’s knowledge and belief, the child is benefiting from these\ncounseling sessions.\n8) That the Father is unskilled in matters of the law and has had to hire the services\nof an attorney to file this motion. The Father was caused to incur legal expenses\nand requests that the Mother be ordered to pay his attorney fees.\nWherefore, the premises considered, the Plaintiff/Father respectfully requests that\nthis Honorable Court require the Defendant/Mother to appear and state unto the Court why she\nshould not be held in willful contempt for thwarting the services of reunification between the\nMother and child. The Plaintiff/Father further requests that the Defendant/Mother be ordered to\npay his attorney fees. The Plaintiff/Father requests any and all such other relief to which he may\nbe entitled, the premises considered.\nRespectfully submitted on this the 31st day of January, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, Alabama 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (Facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nDOCUMENT 117\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing in the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 31st day of January, 2025.\nBarbara H.
