Agricola, with the law firm of Agricola Law, LLC, and\nhereby moves this Honorable Court for a Pendente Lite Hearing. In support thereof, Petitioner\nstates as follows:\n1. Parties appeared before this Honorable Court for a Show Cause Hearing on July 31,\n2024 and announced an agreement on record regarding the terms for reunification\ntherapy for the Minor Child A.K. and Mother, co-parenting, family dinners, and joint\ncounselling sessions. A joint proposed order was to be filed based on the announced\nagreement;\n2. At the time of this filing, the Parties have been unable to reach an agreement on the\nproposed order following this hearing. This is clearly a delay tactic on the Father’s\nbehalf to continue alienating the Minor Child, A.K., from Mother. Both parties have\nfiled proposed orders in this action and no reunification therapy or joint counseling\nsessions have been initiated due to Father’s antics;\n3. Father has significantly pushed back against Mother regarding reunification therapy\nand prohibited Minor Child, A.K., from attending sessions with Mother. See Exhibit\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v. Christopher Blaine McGregor\nCircuit Court of Tallapoosa County, Alabama\nCase No.: 70-DR-2023-900051.01\nMotion for Pendente Lite Hearing\nPage 1 of 4\nDOCUMENT 58\nA, text correspondence between Father, Mother, and Kelly Turner, a reunification\ntherapist;\n4. Father has willfully ignored this Honorable Court’s instruction to the Parties in open\ncourt on July 31, 2024 and blocked Mother’s attempt at receiving school documents.\nSee Exhibit B, Respondent-Father’s text correspondence to Mother informing her that\nhe will instruct Minor Children’s teachers to not send documents home with Mother;\n5. Father has recently filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and verbally expressed to Mother\nthat he has done so in order to delay his required alimony payments to Mother, posing\na significant financial impact on her monthly income. Father has also contacted the\nDepartment of Human Resources to garnish Mother’s wages for child support. See\nExhibit C, Father’s text correspondence with Mother explaining that he will be\ngarnishing Mother’s wages and Exhibit D, letter received from DHR;\n6. On October 10, 2024, while Mother was on the phone with A.K., Father interrupted the\nconversation to degrade Mother in front of Minor Child A.K., using profane language\nand name-calling. Father began using obscene and sexual language in front of both\nMinor Children while still on the phone with Mother, stating that Mother was “rubbing\nbuttholes together” with her boyfriend. Mother filed a police report to document this\nincident in an attempt to prevent Father from interfering with Mother’s communication\nwith Minor Children;\n7. Further, Father has continued to use harassing communications to Mother and people\nassociated with Mother. Father has contacted Mother’s boyfriend’s ex-wife in an\nattempt to cause further drama and turmoil within Mother’s life and portray her in a\nnegative light. Father is spreading rumors and lies about Mother’s parenting and\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v. Christopher Blaine McGregor\nCircuit Court of Tallapoosa County, Alabama\nCase No.: 70-DR-2023-900051.01\nMotion for Pendente Lite Hearing\nPage 2 of 4\nDOCUMENT 58\nbehavior towards Minor Children to manipulate the Minor Children and Mother’s\nfamily and friends in an attempt to turn them against her. See Exhibit E, text messages\nwith Father and Mother’s partner’s ex-wife;\n8. Father is in willful contempt of this Honorable Court’s announced agreement made in\nCourt on July 31, 2024 and has been consistently interfering with Mother’s\ncommunication with Minor Children, specifically A.K., using degrading and obscene\nlanguage to Mother in front of Minor Children, alienating Mother from school-related\nactivities;\n9. Further, a recalculation of child support is in order as Mother has lost a significant\nportion of her income due to Father filing for bankruptcy and ceasing alimony\npayments.\n10. Mother has incurred attorney’s fees due to Father’s contempt and has been forced to\ntake legal action as a result.\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Mother respectfully requests that the\nCourt set this matter for a Pendente Lite Hearing at the earliest available docket and grant the\nfollowing relief:\n1. GRANT Mother’s motion and set this matter for a pendente lite hearing.\n2. Find Father in contempt of this Honorable Court’s announced agreement.\n3. Impose appropriate sanctions to Father to compel compliance with the Parties’ July\nagreement announced on the record.\n4. ORDER that Father pay Mother’s attorney’s fees as a result of Father’s contempt.\n5. GRANT to Mother such other and further relief as the Court deems just, proper,\nand to which in equity and good conscience she may be entitled.\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v.
