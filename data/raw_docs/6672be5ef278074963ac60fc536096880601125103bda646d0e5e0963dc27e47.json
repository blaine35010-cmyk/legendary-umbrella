YOUNG: Yes, sir.\n5 THE COURT: All right. You may call\n6 your first witness.\n7 MR. YOUNG: All right. We'11 call\n8 Blaine McGregor.\n9 Christopher Blaine McGregor\n10 was sworn (affirmed) and testified as follows:\n11 DIRECT EXAMINATION\n12 BY MR. YOUNG:\n13 Q. All right. State your name for the Court.\n14 A. Christopher Blaine McGregor.\n15 Q. And Mr. McGregor, are you married to Brittany\n16 Michelle Gilliland?\n17 A. Yes, sir.\n18 Q. When were y'all married?\n19 A. I'm drawing a blank right now. I forgot our\n20 wedding anniversary. I'm sorry.\n21 Q. How does May the lith sound?\n22 A. May 1lth, yeah.\n23 Q. Okay, and did y'all separate on or about August\n24 the 16th, 2023?\n25 A. Yes, sir.\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n7\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 MR. RADNEY: They got married May the\nN 3rd of 2018, to the extent it matters.\n2. (By Mr. Young) Okay. Is it either the 3rd or the\n11th?\nA. Yeah. Our anniversary was always the 11th.\n6453 We got married on the 3rd.\n7 Q. Give or take a week?\n8 A. Yes, sir.\n9 Q. And you said you were separated on August 16th.\n10 I'll back up. Do you have any children?\n11 A. Yes, sir. I have two children.\n12 Q. What are their names?\n13 A. Adeline Kate McGregor and Bennett McGregor.\n14 Q. Okay. During the course of your marriage, did\n15 you become did you have issues in your marriage?\n--\n16 A. Yeah, there's issues in our marriage.\n17 Q. Can you tell the Court have those issues made\n--\n18 you incompatible?\n19 A. Yes, sir, they've made us incompatible.\n20 Q. Okay. Can you tell me what kind of issues you\n21 had leading up to your separation?\n22 A. There was infidelity in our marriage, which,\n23 you know, in return, brought issues into our\n24 bedroom and intimacy, and other than that, it was\n25 just the discipline of our children. We really\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n8\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 didn't disagree on too much -- any other things\nbesides those two things.\nQ. Did your wife work during the course of your\nmarriage?\n5 A. Yes, sir.\n6\nQ. Did she, at some point, stop working?\n7 A. Yes, sir.\n8 Q. And when was that?\n9 A. In October of '21.\n10 Q. Okay.\n11 A. Around that timeframe, August or October.\n12 Q. Okay. From that point until the time you\n13 separated, was she employed at all?\n14 A. She did ends and odds jobs, but she didn't\n15 have a full-time job, even a part-time job.\n16 Q. Okay. What was the actual trigger that caused\n17 you to seek a divorce in this case?\n18 A. Yes, sir. There have been incidents in the\n19 past where what I would consider to be abuse of\n--\n20 a child, but what triggered me to file for divorce\n21 was I seen it for the first time with my own eyes.\n22 Addie Kate, our daughter, was screaming. She was\n23 in our bedroom, and when I went into the bedroom,\n24 she had our daughter up against the wall. She\n25 slapped her in the face, hit her in the mouth, and\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n9\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 she pulled her by the hair into the living room out\nN of the bedroom.\nQ. Now, you have mentioned, there have been some\n4\nother instances of what you call abuse; correct?\n5 A. Yes, sir.\n6 2. Okay. On those occasions, did you have the\n7 occasion to talk to her about it?\n이 A. In particular, the incident, the last incident\n9 that I seen, she was we talked about that in\n--\n10 detail. Brittany thinks it's okay to slap in the\n11 face.\n12 MR. RADNEY: Wow, wow, wow. Object.\n13 THE WITNESS: It's what she told me.\n14 MR. RADNEY: I think the question was\n15 had he had a conversation with Brittany. I\n16 object to what he may think or assume.\n17 THE WITNESS: In conversation, we\n18 discussed, and Brittany told me that, in her\n19 opinion, that it was okay to slap a kid or\n20 pop them in the mouth if they smarted off to\n21 the adult.\n22 Q. (By Mr. Young) Okay. I want to show you what's\n23 been marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 9 and 10 and ask\n24 if you can describe these two documents?\n25 A. Yeah. This is the incident that I'm referring\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n10\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 to right now. This is where\nQ. Which document are you referring to?\n3 A. Exhibit 9.\nQ. Okay.\n5 A. This is Addie Kate and Brittany were in the\n--\n6 basement practicing for a national dance\nL competition, and when I got upstairs, this is what\n8 Addie Kate's arm 1ooked like. Addie Kate told me\n9 that\n--\n10 MR. RADNEY: Object to anything the\n11 child may have said.\n12 THE COURT: That's sustained.\n13 Q. (By Mr. Young) Okay. After that, did you have\n14 occasion to speak with Brittany about this?\n15 A. Well, Brittany and Addie Kate were both in the\n16 room when we were discussing this. Brittany had\n17 did this to Addie Kate's arm because Addie Kate\n18 wasn't practicing hard enough and putting enough\n19 effort that Brittany thought that needed to happen\n20 and making her faces, and this is the result of\n21 that argument.\n22 Q. Does this photograph accurately depict Addie\n23 Kate's arm on that occasion?\n24 A. Absolutely.\n25 MR. YOUNG: Judge, we would offer No.\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n11\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 9.\n2 THE COURT: Any objection?\n3 MR. RADNEY: No, sir. I mean, I don't\n4 agree how the mark happened, but no\n5 objection.\n6 THE COURT: Right, to the picture. It\n7 is admitted.\n8 (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 9\n9 was admitted into evidence.)\n10 Ο. Plaintiff's Exhibit 10, tell me about that one.\n11 A. This is one that happened way earlier. This\n12 is where Brittany was spanking Addie Kate, and she\n13 hit her with a belt buckle. I wasn't present for\n14 this one. I learned of this later on I was\n-\n15 under the impression\n--\n16 Q. Was it after the photograph was taken?\n17 A. Yes, sir.\n18 Q. Okay.\n19 A. I was under the impression that\n20 MR. RADNEY: Your Honor, object. Не\n21 was only asked to identify a picture.\n22 THE WITNESS: Yes. This Brittany\n--\n23 my daughter told me\n--\n24 MR. RADNEY: Object to what she told\n25 him.\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n12\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 THE COURT: That's sustained. You\n2 can't tell me what somebody told you. If\n3 you'11 listen closely. Just calm down. Slow\n4 down.\n5 THE WITNESS: Yeah. I'm nervous. I'm\n6 sorry.\n7\nTHE COURT: I know you are, but just\n8 calm down, slow down, listen to his question,\n9 and then answer his question.\n10 THE WITNESS: Okay. Sorry.\n11 2. (By Mr. Young) Same thing I told you, wasn't it?\n12 A. Yes, sir.\n13 Q. Okay. Now so that's one of the examples. Did\n--\n14 you talk with Brittany about that mark on that\n15 picture?\n16 A. In this particular photo, for a long time, I\n17 was under the impression that someone at school did\n18 this to our daughter. It wasn't until later on\n19 that I found out that Brittany did this to our\n20 daughter.\n21 Q. Did you speak to Brittany about it?\n22 A. I did, but Brittany denied it for a long time.\n23 MR. YOUNG: Okay. All right. I offer\n24 No. 10, Judge.\n25 THE COURT: Any objection?\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n13\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 MR. RADNEY: No.\n2 THE COURT: It is admitted.\n3 (Whereupon, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 10\n4 was admitted into evidence.)\n5 Q. (By Mr. Young) Now, did you so on the occasion\n--\n6 that you came in the house and witnessed it, what did\n7 you do shortly thereafter?\n8 A. I filed for divorce the next day. I came to\n9 your office, and I told you I needed a divorce.\n10 Q. Okay, and we filed an ex parte thing, and we had\n11 already had the hearing on it, I think, where the\n12 Judge heard from your daughter; is that correct?\n13 A. Yes, sir.\n14 Q. Okay. Now, during the course of your marriage,\n15 did you have well, no. Let me ask you this. I'm\n--\n16 sorry. Let me follow up with this. What kind of\n17 housekeeper was your wife during the course of your\n18 marriage?\n19 A. When me and Brittany both worked, we were a\n20 team. We got the house cleaned together. When\n21 Brittany got terminated from her position,\n22 something changed. I don't know. She just didn't\n23 do anything in the house. The house was not kept\n24 up. There was always dishes in the sink, loads of\n25 clothes on the bed. The house was just not in\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n14\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 order for someone who wasn't working.\nQ. Okay. How did the house get cleaned?\nA. I did the majority of the house cleaning, and\nI worked a lot of hours at that point, and my mom\nwould come over and clean the house.\n6435 Q. Okay. How about the cooking at the house? Who\n1 7 did the cooking?\n8 A. I did 90 percent of the cooking.\n9 2. 90 percent of the cooking. When you got up in\n10 the morning, did you cook breakfast?\n11 A. Well, a lot of times, to be honest, the kids\n12 didn't prefer to have cooked breakfast, but and\n--\n13 Brittany was taking the kids to school, you know,\n14 but if breakfast did get cooked on a Saturday or\n15 Sunday, I took care of those meals. I cooked lunch\n16 and dinner if we ate at home, but yeah, I took care\n17 of all the meals, and I did all the grocery\n18 shopping for all the meals.\n19 2. Okay. How about clothes washing and things like\n20 that? Who did that?\n21 A. I would say I did at least 70 percent of that.\n22 Q. Okay. How about things like medical and dental\n23 care of your children? Who was responsible for that?\n24 A. Now, I will say that Brittany did make sure\n25 the kids, during her time of unemployment, got to\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1\nN\n3 لو\n15\nthe kids' doctors' appointments and stuff. Prior\nto that, when me and Brittany were both working, my\nmother did majority of that.\na\n4 Q. Okay. Now, Blaine, you and your wife have had\n5 instances where they [sic] had been arguments with\n6 some contact, physical contact, is that fair?\n7 A. Yes, sir.\n8 Q. On how many occasions do you think that's\n9 happened during the course of your marriage?\n10 A. I'm sure there's more than I can think of, but\n11 there's two instances that stand out, The latest\n12 incident was I was upstairs in my office, and\n13 Brittany came upstairs and was screaming and\n14 fighting, and she pushed me out of a computer\n15 chair. It happened so fast, it's hard to but\n--\n16 whether she pulled it or she did pull it. All\n--\n17 the computer equipment came over on top of us, and\n18 Addie Kate and Bennett, our kids, had made it\n19 upstairs by that time, and they were standing there\n20 screaming, and I told Addie Kate to my brother\n--\n21 is my next-door neighbor. I told her to go get\n22 help, and she called my brother and started trying\n23 to get help.\n24 MR. RADNEY: Your Honor, object to what\n25 anybody else\n--\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter\nState of Alabama\n16\n5th Judicial Circuit\n1 THE WITNESS: Then my brother came\n--\n2 MR. RADNEY: Object to anything other\n3 people said.\n4 THE COURT: That's sustained as to what\n5 they said, but you can continue.\n6 Q. (By Mr. Radney) Did somebody come to your house?\n7 A. Yeah, my brother came in and\n--\n8 Q. Okay, and when he came in, what happened. What\n9 did Brittany do at that occasion when your brother\n10 came ?\n11 A. My brother in, and he told and\ncome me\n12 Brittany that we needed to get our stuff together,\n13 and he took Addie Kate with him. Brittany took\n14 Bennett with her and then she left the home.\n15 Q. Okay. Relating back to our previous hearing, is\n16 that the incident where she claims that you had\n17 denied her some medical care or whatever?\n18 A. Yes, sir.\n19 Q. And she actually left the house at that point\n20 with your son; is that right?\n21 A. Yes, sir.\n22 Q. Okay. Are there other occasions where she has\n23 where there has been some physical contact between\n24 the two of you?\n25 A. Yes, sir.\nBrooke F. Head, AL-CCR No. 656\nOfficial Court Reporter",
