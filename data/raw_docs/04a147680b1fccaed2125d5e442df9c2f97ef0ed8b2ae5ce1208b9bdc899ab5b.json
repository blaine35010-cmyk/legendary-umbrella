CASE NO.: 70-DR-2023-900051.01\nBRITTANY MICHELLE GILLILAND,\nPetitioner.\nOBJECTION TO RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO CONTINUE\nCOMES NOW, Petitioner BRITTANY GILLILAND, by and through the undersigned\ncounsel of record, Barbara H. Agricola, with the law firm of Agricola Law, LLC, and files this\nObjection to Respondent’s Motion to Continue. In support thereof, Petitioner states as follows:\n1. This action was initiated over a year ago on May 2, 2024;\n2. This action was originally set for September 11, 2025. Respondent filed a Motion to\nContinue on August 14, 2025 [Doc. 247] and this Honorable Court reset the final trial\ndate to October 17, 2025 [Doc. 249];\n3. Respondent is now again filing a Motion to Continue on the grounds that Respondent\nis on Minor Child A.K.’s middle school Homecoming Committee. This is not\nreasonable grounds for continuing this final trial which has already been continued.\nFurther, Respondent admits in his Motion to Continue that he has been aware about\nthis commitment for at least six (6) months, providing him ample time to have resolved\nthis issue;\n4. Further, discovery was issued in this matter on June 24, 2024 [Doc. 16] by Petitioner.\nPetitioner issued supplemental discovery requests on September 15, 2025 [Doc. 265].\nRespondent has thirty (30) days from the issuance of discovery to respond to\nPetitioner’s requests in accordance with the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure. This\nChristopher Blaine McGregor v.

Therefore,\nPetitioner sees no issue in maintaining the trial date that has been currently set;\n5. Continuing this case would be prejudicial to Mother and only serves as another tactic\nby Respondent to alienate Petitioner and prolong this case, in which she has still yet to\nexercise her court-ordered visitation as set out in the .00 case. As it stands, Mother has\nnot exercised her visitation since February 2024;\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner prays this Honorable Court\nDENY Respondent’s Motion to Continue and maintain the October 17, 2025 final trial date.\nRespectfully submitted on September 16, 2025.\n/s/ Barbara H.
