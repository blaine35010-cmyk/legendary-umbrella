Agricola, with the law firm of Agricola Law, LLC, and files this\nReply to Response to Motion to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem. In support thereof, Petitioner states\nas follows:\n1. Respondent alleges that Petitioner’s Motion to Appoint Guardian Ad Litem is without\nmerit. However, Respondent has consistently acted in bad faith and continues to\ninvolve Minor Children in this present action;\n2. Respondent has revealed details of the present action to Minor Children in order to\nfurther drive a wedge between Petitioner and the Minor Children. This includes\nstatements that Petitioner is the reason why the Minor Children, particularly A.K., are\nrequired to participate in family dinners and reunification therapy. This has led A.K. to\nmisunderstand the details surrounding this present action and the Court’s orders that\nhave been made in A.K.’s best interest;\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v.

Respondent has “unclean hands” and therefore should not be exempt from all costs\nassociated with the appointment of a Guardian Ad Litem, as it is the Respondent’s\nactions that have led Petitioner to take this measure;\n4. Furthermore, Respondent has recently filed for bankruptcy and is no longer paying\nPetitioner the $2,000.00 a month she is owed in equity payments from the Final Divorce\nOrder. As a result, Petitioner is in a horrible financial position because Respondent\ncontinues to game the system to avoid compliance with the Court’s Final Order of\nDivorce.\n5. Should a Guardian Ad Litem be appointed, both Parties shall equally split the costs.\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this\nHonorable Court GRANT this Motion and appoint a Guardian ad Litem for the Minor Children\nwith the costs to be split between the Parties.\nRespectfully submitted on December 20, 2024.\n/s/ Barbara H.
