Set Day for Weekly Dinners: The court was very clear that the weekly dinners should take place on Wednesdays.\nThis specific day was ordered to ensure consistency, and we cannot agree to an arrangement that allows for\nvariability based on schedules. This was a critical part of the court's ruling, and it must be reflected accurately in\nthe order.\n2. Reunification Therapy: The reunification therapy cannot be subject to A.K.’s activities. If we allow it to be\ncontingent upon her schedule, there is a risk that it will never happen. The court emphasized the importance of this\ntherapy, and it should take precedence over other activities.\n3. Payment of Expenses: The expenses for the reunification therapy should not be solely the responsibility of the\nmother. The costs must be split in accordance with the divorce decree.\nThese are all extremely reasonable edits. We are simply trying to do what's in the best interests of this child. Please\nrevise the proposed order accordingly and resend it for review.\n-m\nAgricola Law\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=b1896004a3&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1809182473346671906&simpl=msg-f:18091824733466719… 1/4\n9/27/25, 4:31 PM Gmail - FW: Counter Proposal - McGregor/Gilliland\nOn Thu, Aug 29, 2024 at 11:50 AM Carla Culligan <cculligan@mhhlaw.net> wrote:\nThank you and I will let Mr. Young know.\nFrom: Matt Holdren <matt@agricolalaw.com>\nSent: Thursday, August 29, 2024 9:13 AM\nTo: Carla Culligan <cculligan@mhhlaw.net>\nSubject: Re: Counter Proposal - McGregor/Gilliland\nHey Carla-- It's been a wild week.

His\nexact words were, \"Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner whenever you can fit it in once per week\". He also never once said that\nAK had to miss her School related activities & she worked very very hard to make the cheer team at ACMS & it's not fair\nfor her to miss her games because they refuse to work around her scheduled school activities.\nDo you happen to have the proposed order that Tom sent to them?\nThanks again for sending this again this morning! :)\nHave a great week!\n[Quoted text hidden]\nBlaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com> Tue, Sep 3, 2024 at 9:28 AM\nTo: Carla Culligan <cculligan@mhhlaw.net>\nIs the transcript from the court ready from that day?
