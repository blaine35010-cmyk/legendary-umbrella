An order reclassifying a\ncreditor’s claim as a general unsecured claim, instead of a non-dischargeable,\ndomestic support obligation, is a final judgment because it conclusively resolves a\nseparate dispute of the creditor’s claim or priority, such that no further litigation\ninvolving the creditor is necessary. The Eleventh Circuit has held:\nA final decision is generally ‘one which ends the litigation\non the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but\nexecute the judgment.’ In bankruptcy proceedings, it is\ngenerally the particular adversary proceeding or\ncontroversy that must have been finally resolved, rather\nthan the entire bankruptcy litigation. Although courts ‘take\na more liberal view of what constitutes a separate dispute\nfor purposes of appeal’ in bankruptcy cases, the separate\ndispute being assessed must have been finally resolved and\nhave nothing more for the bankruptcy court to do.\nIn re Charter Co., 778 F.2d 617, 621 (11th Cir.1985) (Citations omitted).\n1\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 8 of 19\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\nI. The bankruptcy court erred to reversal by classifying\nCreditor’s Claim Number 19 as a general unsecured\nclaim because the debt to the Creditor is a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nII. Changes made by BAPCPA further support finding the\ndivorce court’s equitable distribution of assets a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nCourse of Proceedings Below\nOn September 20, 2024, Debtor filed his Chapter 13 Voluntary Petition in the\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Eatern Division.\nDoc. 1.

Doc. 84,\n87.\nOn October 2, 2025, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Debtor’s Chapter 13\nPlan. The record on appeal was transmitted to this Court on October 15, 2025. Doc.\n104.\nStatement of Facts\n1. On February 27, 2024, Creditor (or “Former Wife”) and Debtor (or\n“Former Husband”) were divorced following a trial before the Tallapoosa Circuit\nCourt (Alexander City Division) by the entry of a Final Decree of Divorce. See\nExhibit 1 to Doc. 52.\n3\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 10 of 19\n2. The Final Decree of Divorce ordered Debtor to pay to Creditor one-half\nof the equity in the marital residence which is fifty-one thousand, four hundred eleven\ndollars and 21/100 ($51,411.21). Said amount was ordered to be paid as follows:\n$10,000.00 within 10 days of the entry of the Final Decree of Divorce, followed by\nmonthly payments of $2,000.00 per month for 21 consecutive months beginning April\n1, 2024.1 See Exhibit 1 to Doc. 52.\n3. Neither party was ordered to pay alimony. Id.\n4. The Child Support Guidelines Form filed in the parties’ divorce action\n[Form CS-42] shows a wide disparity between the parties’ monthly incomes with the\nDebtor receiving $8,870 per month and the Creditor receiving $1,733 per month. R.\n16, Creditor’s Ex. 2.The Final Decree of Divorce awarded primary physical custody\nof the Parties’ Minor Children to the Former Husband and ordered the Former Wife\nto pay child support to the Former Husband of $617 per month. R. 15, Creditor’s Ex.\n1.\n5. Debtor made payments to Creditor totaling $20,000.00 before filing his\nChapter 13 Petition on September 20, 2024, leaving a balance owing of $32,000.00.\nDoc. 48, ¶ 5.\n1 The Final Decree of Divorce further indicated that if the Former Husband paid\nthe full $51,411.21 within 90 days, he could avoid having to pay a total of $52,000,\notherwise the amount owing would be $52,000. R. 15, Creditor’s Ex. 1.\n4\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 11 of 19\n6. Creditor testified that she needs the $2,000 payments ordered in the\ndivorce decree to meet her monthly financial obligations. R. 17. Creditor further\ntestified that she cannot meet her monthly financial obligations on her monthly\nincome of $1,733. R. 17-18. Creditor testified that she understood that the 21 monthly\npayments of $2,000 to her ordered by the divorce court were to be for her support. R.\n18.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nA domestic support obligation is non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. The\ndecision whether the Debtor’s payment obligation is dischargeable or non-\ndischargeable does not hinge on whether it is a property settlement or alimony. A\nproperty settlement can be a non-dischargeable domestic support obligation if it\nachieves the same goals as a support obligation. The statutory language requires the\ncourt to determine whether the obligation is in the nature of a support obligation. A\ncritical factor in making this determination is whether there is a wide disparity\nbetween the parties’ incomes. In this case, Debtor’s monthly income is more than five\ntimes greater than Creditor’s monthly income.\nIn a case with very similar facts, not addressed by the Court below, this Court\nreversed the bankruptcy court’s determination that Debtor’s obligation was a non-\n5\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 12 of 19\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation. Debtor’s obligation should have been\ndetermined to be a non-dischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Protection and Consumer Protection Act (“BAPCPA”),\npassed by Congress in 2005, made changes to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15), which removed\nthe balancing test from Section 523(a)(15) and made the distinction between domestic\nsupport obligations and other obligations arising from a divorce immaterial in a\ndischargeability analysis. Since the debt owed to a former spouse is not of the kind\ndescribed in § 523(a)(5) that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce—i.e.,\ndistribution of marital property—it is also typically non-dischargeable under 11\nU.S.C. § 523(a)(15).\nARGUMENT\nI. The bankruptcy court erred to reversal by classifying\nCreditor’s Claim Number 19 as a general unsecured\nclaim because the debt to the Creditor is a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nUnder Chapter 13 bankruptcy, domestic support obligations are non-\ndischargeable. In re Benson, 441 Fed.Appx. 650, 651 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam);\nCummings v. Cummings, 244 F.3d 1263, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing 11 U.S.C. §\n523(a)(5)). “A domestic support obligation is a debt owed to a former spouse that was\nincurred as a result of a [separation agreement, divorce decree, or] property settlement\n6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 13 of 19\nagreement that is ‘in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support ... [of that former\nspouse] without regard to whether such debt is expressly so designated.’” Benson,\n441 Fed.Appx. at 651 (quoting 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A)) (emphasis in original)\n(bracketed material added).\nIn Edwards v. Colin, 2017 WL 1822570 (M.D. Ala. May 5, 2017), on appeal\nby the former wife, the District Court reversed a determination by the Bankruptcy\nCourt which had held that the property settlement in the parties’ divorce settlement\nagreement was dischargeable. The Court found that the Bankruptcy Court erred by\nfocusing on whether the parties’ settlement could fairly be classified as a property\nsettlement or as alimony. Id. at *2. In its decision reversing the Bankruptcy Court, the\nDistrict Court reasoned that, based on language from the Benson decision, a property\nsettlement can be a non-dischargeable domestic support obligation. Id. at *3. The\nquestion is whether the award to the Former Wife of half the equity in the marital\nresidence, even if characterized as a “property settlement,” is in the nature of support.\nSee Cummings v. Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1265. Here, the evidence shows that the\nFormer Wife depends on the $2,000 monthly payments to her to meet her financial\nobligations.\nIn Benson, the Eleventh Circuit found that, because of the disparity in the\nparties’ financial positions and because the wife waived alimony in consideration of\n7\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 14 of 19\nthe benefits she received in the agreement, the former husband’s mortgage payments\nwere a non-dischargeable, domestic support obligation. In re Benson, 441 Fed.Appx.\nat 651-52. Here, the CS-42 Form, used to calculate the parties’ respective child\nsupport obligations, showed substantial disparity between the parties’ financial\npositions with the Former Husband receiving $8,870 monthly and the Former Wife\nreceiving $1,733 monthly. R. 16, Creditor’s Ex. 2. Further, the divorce court denied\nthe Former Wife alimony. And the Former Husband’s payments to the Former Wife\nwere spread over a period of 21 months.\nAs the Eleventh Circuit found in Cummings [at 1266], an equitable distribution\nof assets was a non-dischargeable, domestic support obligation, despite permanent\nalimony being denied by the divorce court, and despite the former wife receiving\nrehabilitative alimony in addition to the equitable distribution. The Court reasoned\nthat “[b]ecause a property division often achieves the same goal as a support\nobligation, state courts do not rigidly distinguish between the two.” Id. In this case,\nalimony was denied but there was no rehabilitative alimony awarded either. Thus,\nthere is more reason to consider the divorce court’s equitable division of assets in this\ncase as achieving the same goal as a non-dischargeable, support obligation, just as the\nCourt did in Cummings. See Edwards v. Colin, 2017 WL 1822570 at * 3 (M.D. Ala.\nMay 5, 2017) citing In re Gianakas, 917 F.2d 759, 763 (3d Cir. 1990).\n8\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 15 of 19\nIn the Bankruptcy Court’s decision reclassifying Creditor’s claim as a general\nunsecured claim, the Court relied on language from the decision in In re Colin, 546\nB.R. 455 (Bankr. M.D. Ala. 2016). Doc. 73 at 4. But In re Colin was reversed by\nEdwards v. Colin in the District Court. Despite Creditor’s reliance in her brief and\nargument on Edwards v. Colin, the Bankruptcy Court did not even refer to that\ndecision it its order. Further, the Bankruptcy Court did not make any assessment of\nwhether the divorce court’s equitable division of assets achieves the same goal as a\nsupport obligation. Just as the Bankruptcy Court did in In re Colin, the court below\nerred by focusing on whether the parties’ settlement could fairly be classified as a\nproperty settlement or as alimony. Doc. 73 at 6 (“the Court concludes that the\nObligation is not a domestic support obligation, but a property settlement”). The\nBankruptcy Court should have focused on whether the property settlement achieves\nthe same goal as a support obligation. Edwards v. Colin, 2017 WL 1822570 at * 3\n(M.D. Ala. May 5, 2017) citing In re Gianakas, 917 F.2d 759, 763 (3d Cir. 1990).\nIn this case, it is clear that Debtor’s obligation to Creditor arises from a divorce\ndecree awarding Creditor half of the equity in the marital residence, or $52,000.00,\nsince the total payment was not made within 90 days of the entry of the Final Decree\nof Divorce. Debtor’s pre-petition payments total $20,000, leaving a balance owing\nof $32,000. The divorce court’s division of the parties’ property was a property\n9\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 16 of 19\nsettlement which achieved the same goal as a domestic support obligation. Thus, it\nshould have been determined to be a non-dischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nII. Changes made by BAPCPA further support finding the\ndivorce court’s equitable distribution of assets a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act (“BAPCPA”). Among the changes enacted was 11 U.S.C. §\n523(a)(15), which “removed the balancing test from Section 523(a)(15)2 and made\nthe distinction between domestic support obligations and other obligations arising\nfrom a divorce immaterial in a dischargeability analysis.” In re Ginzl, 430 B.R. 702,\n707 (M.D. Fla. 2010) citing 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, ¶ 523.23, at 523-124 (16th ed.\n2009) (footnote added). Accordingly, since the “[d]ebt owed to a former spouse [is]\n‘not of the kind described’ in § 523(a)(5) that is ‘incurred by the debtor in the course\n2 In pertinent part, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a) provides as follows:\n(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 11921 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b)\nof this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt–\n* * * * *\n(5) for a domestic support obligation;\n* * * * *\n(15) to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor and not of the kind\ndescribed in paragraph (5) that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or\nseparation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order\nof a court of record, or a determination made in accordance with State or territorial\nlaw by a governmental unit;\n10\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 6 Filed 11/21/25 Page 17 of 19\nof a divorce’—i.e., distribution of marital property—[it] is also typically non-\ndischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15).” In re Coon, 522 B.R. 357, 361 (M.D.\nAla. 2014) (bracketed material supplied). Because Debtor’s obligation to pay Former\nWife was incurred in the course of the parties’ divorce proceedings and achieves the\nsame goal as a non-dischargeable, domestic support obligation, Debtor’s obligations\nare non-dischargeable pursuant to the plain language of 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15) and\nCreditor’s claim is entitled to priority under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1)(A).\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the arguments and authorities cited hereinabove, the Order of the\nBankruptcy Court reclassifying Creditor’s Claim Number 19 as a general unsecured\nclaim is due to be reversed.\nRespectfully submitted this 21st day of November, 2025.\n/s/ Algert S.
