Gilliland Visitation Schedule\nREPLY FROM DIANNE:\nHoliday Visitation takes precedent over weekend visitation. Brittany’s weekends in November were the 7, 8, & 9, then 21, 22, & 23…Then it was her rotating\nyear for Thanksgiving. Her December weekends will be 5, 6, & 7, then her next weekend would be 19, 20, & 21 HOWEVER, Blaine’s Christmas is from 12-18-\n2025 to Christmas Day (12-25) at 6:00, then Brittany has 12-25 at 6:00 until 1-1-2026 at 6:00 for her Christmas, then her weekend would be Jan 2, 3, 4.\nALSO, I understand Brittany did not bring Bennett’s eye drops back when she returned him home and he has been without them for 3 days. It is imperative\nthat she immediately return the eyedrops. This bottle cost over $100 and Blaine cannot just run get a re-fill.\nThanks,\nDarlene Y Meadows\nLegal Assistant to Dianne James Davis\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, AL 35010\nbilling@diannedavislaw.com\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\n256-392-3172\nFAX 256-392-3578\nFrom: Aria Barjis <aria@agricolalaw.com>\nSent: Thursday, December 4, 2025 1:32 PM\nTo: Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>\nCc: Barbara Agricola <barbara@agricolalaw.com>; Su Jin Carpenter <suj@agricolalaw.com>; Darlene Meadows <billing@diannedavislaw.com>;\nMaildrop Brittany Gilliland <1f625a84d+matter1681760195@maildrop.clio.com>\nSubject: McGregor v.

As I understand it, Brittany had Bennett on Friday November 21 until Monday\nNovember 24. She also then received Thanksgiving visitation on Wednesday November 26 until Sunday November 30. The holiday visitation period meant that\nBlaine was not able to have Bennett for his weekend. Therefore, Blaine's weekend with Bennett should be this weekend. Brittany's weekend should be next weekend.\nPlease communicate this with Blaine so that there is no confusion, and that Brittany will pick up Bennett next week.

Either way, I think that’s fair & she can pickup at noon. I wouldn’t like that if I was on the other side & I’ll be on the other side\nnext year.\nCan you check one more time if Brittany wants the first half of Christmas break as she brought it up last night at dinner & I told her that we already offered her that\n& she said she hadn’t seen any offers.

Bennett was upset about leaving so I\nsaid well we will all do pouty faces that’s why everybody’s frowning in the photo.\nIn an effort to try to make the transition better on Bennett I said, would you like to show your mom and Bradley your new gaming PC you got for Christmas. Bennett\nsaid yes, Brittany and Bradley briefly came into my home walked into the playroom with us. Bennett showed him his gaming PC & I introduced Bradley to my Dad.\nI then took Bennett outside to Brittany’s Car & made AK come.\nI made a picture and picture frame of the kids for Brittany and Bradley that the kids gave them for Christmas. Brittany opened the gift. Told them thank you. (Kinda\nlike I’ve attached but without me in the photo)\nI put Bennett and Brittany’s car gave him a hug as Addie Kate and Brittany We’re standing in the driveway talking.\nWhen AK came inside, she told me her mom asked her if she was ever going to spend Christmas with her again. AK told her I’ve told you that I’m not ready & I\ndon’t know if I’ll ever be ready. I’ve told you that in order for us to even start to move forward & me to start to be able to build trust with you again that you have to\nadmit to what you’ve done.” It’s the first step..\nI heard some of this conversation. I encouraged AK to go with her mother and after a few minutes said this is between you two. Brittany if you want to take her put\nher in your car I’m going inside. I hope you and Bradley have a merry Christmas.\nBefore coming inside I did encourage AK to give Brittany a hug.\nFYI -\nShe didn’t give AK a single thing for Christmas. Not a gift, Christmas card or anything.\nI also took both Kids to Clanton last Sunday. Bennett attended Candlelight service with Brittany & I encouraged AK to stay as well.\nAfterwards, we met in Prattville for Dinner with Brittany’s Dad so he could see AK for Christmas.\nLet me know if you have any questions. Sorry I missed your call, I can call you this afternoon if you need me to.\nBlaine\n[Quoted text hidden]\n4 attachments\nIMG_2300.jpeg\n5559K\nBazaart_B1D0CC3B-6425-4E9B-B28E-D2F37013464E.png\n1319K\nIMG_2441.jpeg\n2894K\nIMG_2300.jpeg\n5559K\nDarlene Meadows <billing@diannedavislaw.com> Mon, Dec 29, 2025 at 12:42 PM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>, Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>\nBlaine, Thanks for the email.
