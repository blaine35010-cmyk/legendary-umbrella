In re Benson, 441 Fed. App’x at 651.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act\n(“BAPCPA”), the Bankruptcy Court could have found, as an alternative, that the debt\nimposed by the divorce court was non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15).\n1\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 6 of 14\nARGUMENT\nI. The Debtor’s analysis of the Benson factors is flawed.\nDebtor correctly points out that the Court’s decision in In re Benson, 441 Fed.\nApp’x 650, 651 (11th Cir. 2011), requires courts to consider eight factors in\ndetermining whether payments from one spouse to another arising from a divorce\ndecree are domestic support obligations within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A).\nHowever, his analysis of how those factors apply to this case is flawed.\nDebtor’s first mistake is his assumption that Creditor contends the payments\nordered by the divorce court are like an award of periodic alimony. But Creditor has\nnever contended that the payments ordered by the divorce court should be considered\nto be like periodic alimony. Creditor’s position has always been that the award to her\n“is a debt owed to a former spouse that was incurred as a result of a [separation\nagreement, divorce decree, or] property settlement agreement that is ‘in the nature of\nalimony, maintenance, or support ... [of that former spouse] without regard to\nwhether such debt is expressly so designated.’” Benson, 441 Fed.App’x. at 651\n(quoting 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A)) (emphasis in original) (bracketed material added).\nThen Debtor erroneously jumps to the provisions of Alabama law which\ndescribe events that terminate an award of periodic alimony, such as remarriage,\n2\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 7 of 14\ncohabitation, or death. Appellee’s Br. at 13 citing Ala. Code § 30-2-55.1 But a debt\nowed to a former spouse incurred as a result of a divorce decree can be in the nature\nof alimony in gross, maintenance, or support, thus falling within the definition of a\ndomestic support obligation. 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A)\nIn Whitehurst v. Whitehurst, ___ So.3d ___, 2024 WL 4395288 (Ala. Civ. App.\nOct. 4, 2024), the Court stated:\nAlimony in gross is considered “compensation for the\n[recipient spouse’s] inchoate marital rights [and] ... may\nalso represent a division of the fruits of the marriage where\nliquidation of a couple’s jointly owned assets is not\npracticable.” Hager v. Hager, 293 Ala. at 54, 299 So. 2d at\n749. ... In other words, alimony in gross is a form of\nproperty settlement. Hager v. Hager, 293 Ala. at 54, 299\nSo. 2d at 749. An alimony-in-gross award is generally not\nmodifiable. Id.\nId. at *3 (Bracketed material in original).\nThe law is clear that the determination of whether a debt arising from a divorce\ndecree is a domestic support obligation which is non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C.\n§ 523(a)(5), does not turn on whether it is alimony or a property settlement. Edwards\nv. Colin, 2017 WL 1822570, *2 (M.D. Ala. May 5, 2017). A property settlement can\nbe a non-dischargeable domestic support obligation. In re Benson, 441 Fed. App’x\n1 This statute has been held to apply only to an award of periodic alimony.\nTrammell v. Trammell, 523 So.2d 437 (Ala. Civ. App. 1988).\n3\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 8 of 14\nat 651-52; Cummings v. Cummings, 244 F.3d 1263, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2001). The\nquestion is whether the property settlement is “in the nature of support.” Id. at 1265.\nTurning to the eight Benson factors, the proper analysis follows:\n(1) the agreement’s language—there was no agreement in this case so there is no\nindicator of the parties’ intent;\n(2) the parties’ financial positions when the agreement was made—Debtor’s monthly\nincome was over five times more than Creditor’s monthly income which favors a\ndetermination that the debt is for Creditor’s support;\n(3) the amount of the division—the parties’ equity in the marital residence is equal\nto $102,822.42, with the $2,000 monthly payments to Creditor equal to 115% of her\nmonthly income of $1,733, which favors a determination that the debt is for\nCreditor’s support;2\n(4) whether the obligation ends upon death or remarriage of the beneficiary—since\nthe award amounts to half of the parties’ equity in the marital residence, it appears\nmore like a property settlement, and thus, alimony in gross, which does not terminate\n2 Although Debtor is correct in asserting that Creditor will receive 100% of the\ndebt she is owed as a general unsecured creditor, if her claim is a non-dischargeable,\ndomestic support obligation, i.e.,a priority claim, Creditor would receive her payment\nmuch sooner. Appellee Br. at 4, ¶ 17.\n4\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 9 of 14\nupon death or remarriage, which favors a determination that the debt is for Creditor’s\nsupport;3\n(5) the frequency and number of payments—the fact that the divorce decree orders\n21 monthly payments of $2,000 favors a determination that the debt is for Creditor’s\nsupport;\n(6) whether the agreement waives other support rights—the divorce decree provides\nthat neither party is awarded alimony which favors a determination that the debt is for\nCreditor’s support since she receives nothing else from the divorce decree;\n(7) whether the obligation can be modified or enforced in state court—a property\nsettlement such as alimony in gross cannot be modified in state court which favors\na determination that the debt is for Creditor’s support;\n(8) how the obligation is treated for tax purposes—Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nof 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-97, 131 Stat. 2054 (2017), which repealed 26 U.S.C. § 71\nand 26 U.S.C. § 215 (Repealed), alimony payments made pursuant to divorce\njudgments entered after December 31, 2018, are no longer taxable income to the\n3 Debtor argues that because Creditor remarried, Debtor’s support obligation\nterminated. But Debtor again assumes that Creditor’s debt was like periodic alimony,\ninstead of alimony in gross, which is unaffected by Creditor’s remarriage. Regardless,\nCreditor testified that she remarried before the appeal from the judgment of divorce\nin her case was decided. R. 22. Under Ala. Code § 30-2-10, her remarriage was not\nvalid because her judgment of divorce was not final at the time of her remarriage. See\nAppellee Br. at 3, ¶ 13.\n5\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 10 of 14\nrecipient nor tax deductible by the payor. Whitehurst v. Whitehurst, ___ So.3d ___,\n2024 WL 4395288, at *4 (Ala. Civ. App. Oct. 4, 2024). This factor does not apply.\nThus, proper analysis of the Benson factors weighs heavily in favor of\ndetermining that the award to Creditor of half the equity in the marital home was\nintended to function as support for Creditor. In re Benson, 441 Fed. App’x at 651.\nII. Changes made by BAPCPA further support finding the\ndivorce court’s equitable distribution of assets a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation.\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act (“BAPCPA”). Debtor candidly admits that he does not understand\nCreditor’s argument that 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15), one of the changes brought about\nby BAPCPA, is an alternative basis upon which this Court can find that the divorce\ncourt’s award to Creditor of half the equity in the marital home is a non-\ndischargeable, domestic support obligation. Creditor appreciates Debtor’s candor.\nIn In re McCollum, 415 B.R. 625 (M.D. Ga. 2009), the Court explained the\ndifference between non-dischargeability under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5) and under 11\nU.S.C. § 523(a)(15). The Court stated:\nSubsection (a)(15) applies to debts that do not fall with\n[sic] the definition of a domestic support obligation but\nwere, nevertheless, “incurred by the debtor in the course of\na divorce or separation or in connection with a separation\nagreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of\n6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 11 of 14\nrecord[.]” Id. § 523(a)(15). For expediency, debts under §\n523(a)(5) are generally referred to as being in the nature of\nalimony or support, while debts under § 523(a)(15) are\nreferred to as being in the nature of property division.\nId. at 629.\nSince debts “in the nature of a property division” can be in the nature of\nsupport, they can still be non-dischargeable, domestic support obligations within the\nmeaning of 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A). In re Benson, 441 Fed. App’x at 651-52;\nCummings v. Cummings, 244 F.3d 1263, 1266-67 (11th Cir. 2001). Thus, the\nBankruptcy Court could have found, alternatively, that the debt was non-\ndischargeable under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(15).\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the arguments and authorities cited hereinabove, the Order of the\nBankruptcy Court reclassifying Creditor’s Claim Number 19 as a general unsecured\nclaim is due to be reversed.\n7\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 12 Filed 12/31/25 Page 12 of 14\nRespectfully submitted this 31st day of December, 2025.\n/s/ Algert S.
