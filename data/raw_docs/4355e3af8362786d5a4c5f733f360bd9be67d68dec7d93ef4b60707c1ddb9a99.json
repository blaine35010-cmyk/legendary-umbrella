However, as seen by Father’s prior history in blocking any and all visitation with the Minor Child A.K., it should come as no surprise to this Court that Mother was unable to exercise her holiday visitation; \nThe fact they stated “However, as seen by Father’s prior history in blocking any and all visitation with the Minor Child A.K., it should come as no surprise to this Court that Mother was unable to exercise her holiday visitation;” is a problem and a lie. \nMother asserts that Father has a “history in blocking any and all visitation” with A.K. and suggests this is why she was unable to exercise Christmas 2025 visitation. This assertion is both unsupported by the record and mischaracterizes the procedural history of this case.\n\nThey have provided no proof that I have blocked any visation.\nThe court agreed after an in camera interview with AK – Read Transcript. Use Quote from Judge. \nFather did not deny visitation in willful disregard of the Court’s order. Rather, as detailed in prior filings and incorporated herein, he informed Mother of a long-planned church retreat for A.K. during the holiday window, which was communicated on December 15, 2025, with the deposit having been paid months earlier. – See attached Text messages\nThe allegation that Father has a “history of blocking any and all visitation” is contrary to the record. In fact, the Court has previously declined to find Father in contempt. At the July 2024 hearing, Judge Perryman stated explicitly that Father’s conduct did not amount to contempt, recognizing the child’s unwillingness and the complexity of the situation.\nIt is inaccurate to claim that Father “blocked” holiday visitation when, as detailed in the prior response, A.K. herself declined to leave with her mother on December 25, 2025. Father informed Mother in advance of A.K.’s church retreat, attempted to facilitate the exchange, and encouraged A.K. to go. At no point did he interfere with the order.\nThis pattern does not reflect obstruction. It reflects ongoing adherence to the Court’s directives under difficult circumstances involving a minor child with unresolved emotional resistance to visitation—resistance that the Court has acknowledged and structured its orders around.\nThe Court has never found Father in contempt regarding visitation. Assertions that he has ignored court warnings or acted willfully to prevent Mother’s parenting time are not supported by rulings or the procedural history. The record instead shows a consistent and cautious judicial approach focused on gradual reunification and therapeutic readiness—not forced visitation against a resistant child’s will.\n\n6. On December 4, 2025, the undersigned’s office reached out to opposing counsel to confirm the holiday visitation dates per the agreement. Opposing counsel stated, “Blaine’s Christmas is from 12-18-2025 to Christmas Day (12-25) at 6:00, then Brittany has 12-25 at 6:00 until 1-1-2026 at 6:00 for her Christmas, then her weekend would be Jan 2, 3, 4,” which the undersigned then confirmed and relayed to Mother. The undersigned corrected that the pick-up time for Mother on December 25, 2025 is in fact 12:00pm, not 6:00pm which opposing counsel previously stated, which was confirmed by the opposing counsel in order to avoid any potential miscommunication between Mother and Father when the time to exchange the Minor Children came;\nFurther undermining Mother’s argument, she failed to exercise her regular custodial weekend immediately following the holiday. On January 1, 2026, she returned Bennett to Father at approximately 6:00 p.m. but did not return to pick him up for her scheduled visitation from January 2 through January 4. This occurred despite her claim that she coordinated exchange plans through counsel to avoid any confusion. No contact or attempt was made by Mother to retrieve Bennett for that visitation period. This omission reflects a lack of follow-through on Mother’s part and contradicts the narrative that miscommunications or Father’s actions have obstructed her access to the children.\n7. On December 21, 2025, the Parties met for their weekly family dinner. During this dinner, Father explained that the Minor Child, A.K., had planned for an extracurricular trip through her church from December 27, 2025 until January 6, 2026. This would “coincidentally” conflict with Mother’s holiday visitation which was to begin on December 25, 2025 and end on January 1, 2026. Since this was during Mother’s visitation, she had arranged for A.K. to attend a family gathering before promptly returning A.K. to Father’s home for her trip;\nResponse to Allegation No. 7 – Alleged Withholding of Information and Mischaracterization of Trip\nMother claims that Father interfered with visitation and failed to provide information related to A.K.’s holiday plans, referring specifically to an “extracurricular trip.” This allegation is inaccurate and omits essential facts.\nThe trip at issue was not a generic extracurricular activity—it was a church youth retreat organized by First Baptist Church in Alexander City, Alabama, scheduled for December 27 through December 30, 2025, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Father informed Mother of the trip well in advance and sought her input and permission. On December 15, 2025, Father texted Mother stating:\n“AK wants to do this… it’s $200. It’s 12/27 – 12/30. Do you have a problem with her going out of state to TN for it?”\nHe also attached the official link to the church’s Winterblast 2025 page, providing full details of the event and payment information. At no point did Mother respond with any objection or concern. Then, on December 26, 2025, Father sent another message to remind Brittany of the trip and offer her a chance to speak with A.K. before departure:\n“AK leaves for TN in the morning for winterblast. I have to have her at the church at 7am – they return Tuesday. Call her tonight before she leaves.”\nThese texts, backed by screenshots, show clear communication, transparency, and an opportunity for Mother to participate. The claim that the trip was concealed is contradicted by this documented effort to inform and involve her.\nPoint out it’s a lie that I told Brittany about this trip duing the 12/21 Dinner as proof provided by the text. Point out that the trip was not from 12/27 until 1/6 but just as I outlined in the text it was from 12/27 – 12/30. \n8. Following this dinner, Mother received a phone call from Father where he had only mentioned the Minor Child, B.M., for holiday visitation;\nMother asserts that Father’s use of only one child’s name during a phone call was intended to exclude or imply that A.K. would not be made available for visitation. This assumption is incorrect and unsupported.\nIf Father referenced only one child (such as Bennett) during a call, it was not intended to imply that A.K. would be withheld. The name mentioned likely reflected the specific logistical detail being discussed at that moment—not an exclusion of the other child. At no time did Father state or suggest that A.K. would not be made available. In fact, A.K. was present and available for the December 25, 2025 exchange, and Brittany personally interacted with both children during that time.\nThe last contact between the parties prior to the holiday exchange occurred before Father left the December 21, 2025 family dinner in Prattville, Alabama. That gathering—attended by Brittany, her husband, their children, and Brittany’s extended family—did not conclude until approximately 10:30 p.m. Father then made the 1.5-hour drive back to Alexander City and did not have further communication with Brittany before the scheduled exchange. The fact that Brittany saw both children on December 25, spoke with A.K., and invited her to join a family event confirms that A.K. was not being hidden or withheld.\nFather complied with the Court’s holiday order, and any mention of only one child during a phone call cannot be reasonably interpreted as an attempt to interfere with or mislead regarding visitation.\n10. When the exchange of the Minor Children occurred on December 25, 2025, Father asked if the pick-up time could be pushed back one hour so that Minor Child B.M. could play with his Christmas present. Mother informed Father that she was already on the road to pick up the Minor Children, to which Father then informed B.M. that Mother refused to allow him to play with his toy, causing B.M. to be upset with Mother upon Mother’s arrival. This was another manipulation tactic by Father to foster negative emotions towards Mother and to change the Minor Child’s perception of Mother;\nMother alleges that Father made disparaging remarks to the parties’ minor son, B.M., on Christmas Day, specifically claiming that Father told B.M. that “his Mother refused to allow him to play with his toys,” causing B.M. to be upset with her upon her arrival. This allegation is entirely false and misrepresents the events of that day.\nOn December 25, 2025, Father called Mother at 11:00 a.m., one hour before the scheduled 12:00 p.m. pickup time, to ask when she would arrive. Brittany confirmed that she was already on her way. Father did not inform Bennett that his mother was coming to pick him up until she had already arrived, specifically to avoid upsetting him in advance. When Father told Bennett that his mother was outside, Bennett became visibly upset about the transition.\nTo help ease the exchange and make the moment more positive, Father asked Brittany’s husband, Bradley, to take a picture of him with the children on the front steps. He also invited Brittany to take a picture with them, and she agreed. Because Bennett was still emotional, Father suggested that everyone do “pouting faces” in the photos to help lighten the mood and make it feel more playful. A copy of that photo is attached as evidence.\nIn further effort to support the transition, Father asked Bennett if he wanted to show his mom what Santa had brought. When Bennett said yes, Father invited Brittany and her husband into the home, and Bennett proudly showed them his new gaming PC in the playroom. During this brief visit, Father also introduced Bradley to his father. Afterward, everyone went back outside, and Father placed Bennett in Brittany’s vehicle.\nThe suggestion that Father told Bennett something negative about his mother is unsupported and contradicted by these actions. Father clearly made every effort to create a warm, peaceful, and emotionally supportive exchange—not one based in tension or manipulation.\nFather has consistently gone above and beyond to support the children's relationship with their mother, including:\nMoving Christmas (Santa) to December 23 to prevent B.M. from experiencing the emotional conflict of receiving gifts and then having to leave a few hours later on Christmas Day;\nFacilitating calls between the children and Brittany the night before and the morning of Santa’s visit at his home;\nBringing both children to attend Brittany’s church’s candlelight service in Clanton on December 21st then making another 1 hr drive and to have Christmas dinner with Brittany’s extended family in Prattville on December 21 and then driving 1.20 min home that night.\nParticipating in a family dinner and Walmart outing just days before this filing, during which Brittany took pictures of Father with her infant daughter.\nThese events show a consistent pattern of cooperation and care—not alienation or manipulation. Father categorically denies making any statement to B.M. that would cast Mother in a negative light, and he strongly objects to the repeated use of language suggesting that he employs “manipulation tactics.” The documented facts show otherwise: that Father supports co-parenting and has acted in the best interests of both children.\n11. Furthermore, Father’s sister, Katie McGregor, was at Father’s residence helping the Minor Child ,A.K., pack for her trip at the time of the visitation exchange. When Mother asked if A.K. was coming with B.M. into the car for pick up, Father reportedly stated “if you want to go you can go” to A.K., to which she declined and went back inside Father’s residence;\nMother alleges that Addie Kate was “packing for her church youth trip” during the scheduled Christmas Day pickup, implying she was unavailable. This is false. At the time of the exchange on December 25, 2025, at 12:00 p.m., A.K. was not packing. Both children came outside for the exchange. Photos were taken of the family on the front steps. Afterward, everyone returned inside briefly so Bennett could show Brittany and Bradley his Christmas gifts. Father then placed Bennett in Brittany’s vehicle.\nWhile outside, Brittany asked A.K. if she would like to go with her to a family gathering at Bradley’s family’s home. She told A.K. she would bring her back later that evening. Father encouraged A.K. to go, but did not pressure her. As the discussion continued between A.K. and her mother, Father stated:\n“This is between you and your mother,”\nand then went inside the home. About ten minutes later, A.K. came inside. Father did not interfere in their discussion and did not obstruct the visitation.\nMother’s additional claim that “Katie” was present in the home during this exchange is also false. Katie is not Father’s sister, but his sister-in-law, and she was not present at the home during the pickup. Dated and timestamped video surveillance footage from Katie’s residence confirms that she remained at her own home until approximately 3:00 p.m. on Christmas Day—three hours after the exchange occurred. The only other person present at Father’s home during the pickup was his father.\nThis is another unsupported accusation and a clear attempt to misrepresent the facts before the Court.\n12. This Court has been explicitly clear regarding visitation especially as it relates to putting the responsibility of exercising visitation in the Minor Child A.K.’s hands. Father has previously made and continues to make zero attempt to encourage visitation between the Minor Child A.K. and Mother and consistently engages in parental alienation;\nFather did not unilaterally “leave the decision up to the child.” If Mother had wished to enforce the visitation or believed Father was obstructing it, she could have involved law enforcement, as she has on prior occasions. She did not do so. The Court has never found Father in contempt for these exchanges, and in fact, both counsel and the Court agreed after the in camera interview with A.K. that the previously scheduled show cause hearing would not proceed. That decision followed the Court’s acknowledgment that A.K.’s statements carried weight in determining visitation progress.\nAccusations that Father has made “zero attempts” to support visitation or that he engages in “parental alienation” are direct attacks on his character and are not supported by the record. Father has encouraged visitation, attended therapy, facilitated communication, and followed the court’s orders. The in camera interview and court’s subsequent actions contradict Mother’s narrative.\n\n13. On July 24, 2025, this Court issued an Order stating, in part, “Both parties are to parent and not permit the/a child to control the operations of this Court’s orders.” See July 24, 2025 Order [Doc. 222]\nMother previously attempted to enforce visitation under an outdated version of the custody order, despite the fact that a newer Temporary Order was in effect. Her filing to enforce a superseded schedule prompted Father to file a Motion to Clarify, which was granted by the Court on August 7, 2025. That order confirmed the most recent order controlled and clarified that the schedule Mother was attempting to enforce was no longer valid. Both the April 14, 2025 Temporary Order and the August 7, 2025 Clarification Order are attached.\nThese events show that any confusion in the record stemmed from Mother’s attempt to act under a repealed order—not from Father’s conduct.\n14. This Court also stated during the July 31, 2024 Show Cause Hearing that “I don’t mind talking to her again and letting her know if she don’t do what I tell her she’s got to do, then I may have to change custody.” See Transcript page 6, lines 16-18 [Doc. 138] and, “A ten-year-old can’t tell us what we’re going to do,” See Transcript page 6, line 25 [Doc. 138];\nMother cites early remarks made by Judge Perryman, such as:\n“I don't mind talking to her again and letting her know if she don't do what I tell her she's got to do, then I may have to change custody, and a ten-year-old can't tell us what we're going to do.”\nThese comments were made before the judge heard any evidence and before conducting the in camera interview with A.K. After speaking with A.K. directly, Judge Perryman shifted tone significantly. He ordered only weekly family dinners as visitation and denied reunification therapy, responding to Mother’s counsel’s question with:\n“No, not now.”\nHe made clear that the Court would not force visitation without therapeutic support and emotional readiness. The in camera interview was central to this shift in the Court’s approach, demonstrating the judge’s responsiveness to the facts and to A.K.’s lived experience.\n15. This Court’s position has been made clear since the initiation of this action that the Minor Child is not to dictate whether visitation is to be exercised. Father has continued to blatantly disregard this Court’s orders and refuses to bear any responsibility for ensuring that visitation is properly exercised. Father continues to place this burden onto a minor and instills distaste towards A.K.’s own mother, creating a rift and severing any familial bond that Mother attempts to create, which is the definition of parental alienation. Indeed, Father has even successfully blocked the reunification therapy that was ordered by the Court with no consequences;\nChristopher Blaine McGregor (“Father”) has scrupulously followed the court’s custody and visitation orders and, in many instances, exceeded their requirements to facilitate the children’s relationship with Brittany Gilliland (“Mother”). As Father affirms, “I have fully complied with all court-ordered visitation arrangements and often exceeded them to support the children’s relationship with their Mother.” Far from instilling distaste for Mother or alienating the children, Father has consistently encouraged contact and goodwill. For example, during holidays in 2024 – when the Final Decree did not entitle Mother to Thanksgiving custody – Father voluntarily arranged extra time for Mother to be with the children. He allowed Mother to have dinner with A.K. on Thanksgiving Eve and spend special time with the younger child, even though this was beyond what the court order required. On Mother’s Day 2025, Father helped both children prepare gifts for Mother and invited Mother to join A.K. for dinner – an offer Mother declined. Father still brought A.K. out to Mother’s car that day to ensure A.K. could hand over the gifts and personally wish Mother a happy Mother’s Day. These actions demonstrate Father’s good-faith efforts to nurture, not undermine, the mother–child bond.\nAt no point has Father engaged in a campaign of disparagement or blocked the children’s communication with Mother. In fact, the record shows Father facilitated phone calls, gift exchanges, and counseling sessions aimed at reunifying Mother and A.K.. He has never spoken negatively about Mother to the children.\nFather has obeyed both the letter and spirit of those provisions. The only impediments to Mother’s relationship with A.K. have been those arising from A.K.’s own well-founded emotional reservations and Mother’s repeated failure to take advantage of visitation opportunities – not any interference or poisoning of the well by Father.\nFather Did Not “Let the Child Control” Visitation: Allegation 15 claims Father allows the minor child to dictate visitation. This is incorrect. Father has encouraged A.K. to attend scheduled visits and therapy, but he also must respond to the reality of A.K.’s trauma and fear.\nWhat Father refuses to do is forcibly drag a terrified child into a car against her will without addressing the underlying issues. As he explained, “I cannot in good conscience force our child into a situation that she finds scary or traumatic.” This approach is entirely consistent with the Court’s guidance. At the July 31, 2024 hearing (before A.K.’s in-camera interview), Judge Perryman emphasized that the goal was to avoid “screwing up” the child and to rebuild trust gradually: “we’re going to send everybody to counseling, and then we’ll be back here and see if we can’t get things better.” The Judge made clear that reunification therapy should start slowly – first with A.K. and her individual counselor, then joint sessions with Mother “after y’all have some indication … that things are progressing”. In line with that intent, Father has prioritized A.K.’s emotional well-being while encouraging her to heal and eventually resume normal visitation. He is not “controlled” by the child; he is following professional and court guidance to ensure that contact is meaningful and not harmful.\nMother Missed ~50% of Court-Ordered Reunification Dinners: The contempt allegation faults Father for allegedly withholding visitation, but the factual record shows it has been Mother who failed to show up to visitation opportunities. After the divorce, the Court ordered weekly “reunification dinners” to help reintroduce Mother into A.K.’s life (originally Wednesday evenings, later moved to Sundays). From January through August 2025, roughly 30 weekly reunification dinners were scheduled – and Mother missed more than half of them. Some she canceled in advance with flimsy excuses; others she simply no-showed, leaving A.K. waiting. Each absence is documented in text messages and logs (Exhibits A–C) – for example, on January 10, 2025, Mother asked to reschedule a dinner to Saturday morning, which Father agreed to, but then Mother never appeared at the rescheduled time. On February 12, 2025, Mother neither showed up nor gave notice, then later tried to blame Father by claiming she wasn’t informed of the plan (despite a standing court order and shared Google calendar). The pattern continued through the spring and summer: Easter Sunday (April 20, 2025) – Mother failed to participate; Mother’s Day (May 11, 2025) – Mother again skipped the chance to see A.K., aside from picking up the younger child; multiple Sundays in June–August 2025 – Mother would cancel last-minute or simply never respond to Father’s messages about meeting times. By August, Mother was outright refusing to come to the designated location (Alexander City) at all, insisting Father drive A.K. to meet her halfway – contrary to the court’s order that Mother exercise visitation in Alex City. In sum, Mother’s own choices “resulted in any disruption of visitation,” not Father’s actions. Father, for his part, kept every weekly dinner slot open, had the children ready and waiting, and frequently reached out to confirm Mother’s plans – only to be met with silence or cancellations. He even adjusted schedules repeatedly at Mother’s request (e.g. moving visits from Wednesdays to Sundays to accommodate Mother’s work and relocation). The undisputed record is that Father was present for every scheduled exchange; it was Mother who more often failed to appear or cut visits short.\nMother Missed ~75% of A.K.’s Medical Appointments: The allegation that Father blocks Mother from the child’s life is further disproven by Mother’s own absence at critical events like doctor’s appointments. Father has kept Mother informed of all major medical visits for the children. Yet Mother has attended only a small fraction of A.K.’s medical and therapy appointments since the divorce. The attendance log of health visits (Exhibit __) shows that Mother was a no-show for roughly three out of every four appointments. By way of illustration, at A.K.’s pediatric sick visit on August 28, 2023, the clinic records note “Brittany – No Show”, with Father having to accompany A.K. alone. This was not an isolated incident – it is representative of a trend. Mother consistently failed to appear despite having joint notice and rights, thereby forgoing opportunities to engage in A.K.’s health and daily life. It is ironic for Mother to accuse Father of blocking communication with the school or medical providers, when the reality is Mother seldom shows up even when she is expected. Father cannot be blamed for Mother’s own lack of involvement. To the contrary, Father has never barred Mother from any school or medical information – he has provided updates and even added Mother to shared calendars for events. If Mother missed a vaccine appointment or a school function, it was due to her absence or inattention, not because Father hid it from her. In fact, the Final Decree’s joint legal custody terms require both parents to confer on major decisions, and Father has abided by that – for instance, consulting Mother about A.K.’s counseling and inviting her input on activities. It is Mother who chose not to attend or sometimes not even to respond.\nMother Missed ~94% of A.K.’s Extracurricular Activities: Father also documents that Mother has rarely supported A.K. at her extracurricular activities. A.K. is an active pre-teen with sports and school events. Father ensured Mother was informed of all games, recitals, and activities, and the schedule was readily available. Yet Mother’s attendance has been abysmal. Out of A.K.’s entire 2024–2025 sports season, Mother attended only 1 of 12 of A.K.’s soccer games, 2 of 16 of her cheer/football games, and 0 of 30 basketball games. In total, Mother was present for just 3 out of 58 games – a 5% attendance rate, meaning she missed approximately 94% of A.K.’s events. Again, this underscores that if anyone has been absent from the child’s life, it is Mother. Father, by contrast, was at every game or practice, and even took on all the driving and expenses for these activities (often with no contribution from Mother). Father also made sure Mother knew she was welcome at all events; he never discouraged her from coming. Her near-total non-attendance speaks for itself. It is simply not credible for Mother to claim Father “alienated” the child, when Mother has voluntarily alienated herself by failing to show basic support and presence. As Father notes, he has “gone out of my way to facilitate Mother’s visitation, and it is Mother who has often been unable or unwilling to utilize the time allotted to her.” Any suggestion that Father prevented Mother from being involved is flatly false.\nIn summary, the evidence of the past two years shows Father has bent over backwards to include Mother – flexible scheduling, extra holiday time, constant communication – while Mother has spurned half or more of the opportunities given to her. This directly refutes Allegation 15’s premise that Father is the one flouting court orders or poisoning the children’s minds. On the contrary, Father’s compliance and facilitation are well-documented, and it is Mother’s pattern of non-compliance that has hindered her relationship with A.K.\nFather’s Efforts to Encourage and Continue Reunification Therapy\nAllegation 15 also accuses Father of “blocking reunification therapy.” The record proves the opposite. Father has been the driving force behind initiating, maintaining, and when necessary, re-starting reunification therapy between Mother and A.K. Far from impeding therapy, Father has diligently followed every court directive and even sought corrections when the process derailed due to no fault of his own.\nCourt’s Intent vs. Written Order: It is important to recall the court’s intended plan for reunification therapy. During the July 31, 2024 hearing (where the Court interviewed A.K. in camera), Judge Perryman made the gradual approach clear on the record: A.K. would first continue individual counseling (with Mother participating in some of those sessions), and only after progress was observed would a separate reunification therapist commence joint Mother–daughter therapy. The Judge specifically said Mother should attend counseling sessions with A.K.’s regular counselor “at least eight/ten times” and “that needs to start immediately”, and “then a separate reunification [counselor] after we get down the road with this a little bit and see if we can’t get things better.”*. Father understood this phased plan and agreed with it – it aligned with ensuring A.K. was emotionally ready. However, when the written order came out on November 6, 2024, it omitted the phase-in sequence and instead directed that reunification therapy with a specific counselor (Kelly Turner) begin right away. Despite concerns that this contradicted the court’s stated intent, Father complied fully with the November 6 order. He did not challenge or ignore it; rather, he promptly facilitated the ordered therapy: he allowed Mother’s attorney to choose the reunification therapist (Ms. Turner), let Mother set the initial appointments, and made A.K. available for every scheduled session.\nFull Compliance and Participation: Father never impeded the reunification counseling. To the contrary, he went to great lengths to make it successful. He provided a shared Google calendar to both Mother and Ms. Turner to coordinate sessions and communicated his openness and availability for any appointment. Father made sure to attend with A.K. every session that was scheduled and communicated to him. He even rearranged other family plans – for example, cutting short a family Christmas gathering on December 23, 2024 – because Mother and Ms. Turner set a therapy session that day. (Notably, Mother herself missed that December 23 session after insisting on it; she and the therapist canceled last-minute after Father and A.K. had already altered their holiday plans to attend.) Father’s dedication is summed up in his affidavit: “I attended with A.K. whenever sessions were set, and I went so far as to leave holiday family time and rearrange schedules to make therapy a priority.” He never once refused a session, never showed up late (aside from instances where Mother failed to confirm times), and never caused a cancellation. In fact, Father confirms, “I never missed or canceled a session that I was made aware of, and I accommodated every appointment that was communicated to me.” The same cannot be said for Mother – it was her inconsistent scheduling and attendance that undermined the continuity of therapy.\nTherapist Kelly Turner’s Withdrawal: The reunification therapy with Ms. Turner ultimately fell apart not because of any act of Father, but because Ms. Turner herself unilaterally withdrew from the case after only two joint sessions. Critically, Ms. Turner’s own communications and affidavit make clear why she quit – and it was not due to Father “blocking” anything. On February 12, 2025, Ms. Turner submitted an affidavit (since she could not attend a hearing) in which she made certain “prejudicial statements regarding the Father” despite never having met or spoken with him in person. She admitted her conclusions were based solely on limited email interactions. Father’s counsel rightfully sought to cross-examine these conclusions by noticing Ms. Turner for a deposition on February 14, 2025. That same night (Feb. 14), at 11:46 PM, Ms. Turner emailed both parties stating: “I am removing myself from this case. I wish you both the best… I am not going to be able to continue to assist moving forward. If you need any suggestions for other therapists I can provide options.” Ms. Turner specifically referenced an email from Father (in which Mother was allegedly not copied) as the reason for her abrupt withdrawal. Father was baffled by this, as he had included Mother on all communications and immediately responded asking what email she was referring to. It later emerged that Mother had been emailing Ms. Turner separately behind the scenes – for example, Mother confirmed an appointment time with Ms. Turner via a private email that excluded Father. Thus, any confusion about who was attending or confirming sessions was caused by Mother’s unilateral communications, not by Father. Ms. Turner apparently “felt” manipulated by the situation (perhaps due to these crossed communications) and chose to quit. But the key point is this: Father did not fire or pressure the therapist to withdraw. Ms. Turner’s own affidavit states, “this situation felt highly manipulative and… I realized that this process was not going to be conducive nor effective, and a decision was made to withdraw.” Those were her words and decision. Father was blindsided by Ms. Turner’s exit; he had been preparing to attend every session and was “ready and willing to continue the reunification therapy” with her. There is no evidence whatsoever that Father caused or encouraged Ms. Turner’s withdrawal. In fact, the evidence shows the opposite – Father was dismayed by her quitting and took immediate steps to get the therapy back on track with a new\nAllegation 15 also accuses Father of “blocking reunification therapy.” The record proves the opposite.

Father made sure to attend with A.K. every session that was scheduled and communicated to him. He even rearranged other family plans – for example, cutting short a family Christmas gathering on December 23, 2024 – because Mother and Ms. Turner set a therapy session that day. (Notably, Mother herself missed that December 23 session after insisting on it; she and the therapist canceled last-minute after Father and A.K. had already altered their holiday plans to attend.) Father’s dedication is summed up in his affidavit: “I attended with A.K. whenever sessions were set, and I went so far as to leave holiday family time and rearrange schedules to make therapy a priority.” He never once refused a session, never showed up late (aside from instances where Mother failed to confirm times), and never caused a cancellation. In fact, Father confirms, “I never missed or canceled a session that I was made aware of, and I accommodated every appointment that was communicated to me.” The same cannot be said for Mother – it was her inconsistent scheduling and attendance that undermined the continuity of therapy.\nTherapist Kelly Turner’s Withdrawal: The reunification therapy with Ms. Turner ultimately fell apart not because of any act of Father, but because Ms. Turner herself unilaterally withdrew from the case after only two joint sessions. Critically, Ms. Turner’s own communications and affidavit make clear why she quit – and it was not due to Father “blocking” anything. On February 12, 2025, Ms. Turner submitted an affidavit (since she could not attend a hearing) in which she made certain “prejudicial statements regarding the Father” despite never having met or spoken with him in person. She admitted her conclusions were based solely on limited email interactions. Father’s counsel rightfully sought to cross-examine these conclusions by noticing Ms. Turner for a deposition on February 14, 2025. That same night (Feb. 14), at 11:46 PM, Ms. Turner emailed both parties stating: “I am removing myself from this case. I wish you both the best… I am not going to be able to continue to assist moving forward. If you need any suggestions for other therapists I can provide options.” Ms. Turner specifically referenced an email from Father (in which Mother was allegedly not copied) as the reason for her abrupt withdrawal. Father was baffled by this, as he had included Mother on all communications and immediately responded asking what email she was referring to. It later emerged that Mother had been emailing Ms. Turner separately behind the scenes – for example, Mother confirmed an appointment time with Ms. Turner via a private email that excluded Father. Thus, any confusion about who was attending or confirming sessions was caused by Mother’s unilateral communications, not by Father. Ms. Turner apparently “felt” manipulated by the situation (perhaps due to these crossed communications) and chose to quit. But the key point is this: Father did not fire or pressure the therapist to withdraw. Ms. Turner’s own affidavit states, “this situation felt highly manipulative and… I realized that this process was not going to be conducive nor effective, and a decision was made to withdraw.” Those were her words and decision. Father was blindsided by Ms. Turner’s exit; he had been preparing to attend every session and was “ready and willing to continue the reunification therapy” with her. There is no evidence whatsoever that Father caused or encouraged Ms. Turner’s withdrawal. In fact, the evidence shows the opposite – Father was dismayed by her quitting and took immediate steps to get the therapy back on track with a new counselor.\n16. After numerous instances of Father showing clear disregard for this Court’s authority it is abundantly clear that Fathershould be held in contempt of this Court and be ordered to pay attorney’s fees to Mother associated with all filings related to the Parties’ holiday visitation. Mother also requests that make-up visitation time between the Minor Child A.K. be ordered immediately as zero visitation between A.K. and Mother was exercised due to Father’s noncompliance. WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Mother respectfully prays this Honorable Court hold Father in contempt of this Court and ORDER attorney’s fees associated with the filing of this motion and other related filings be paid by Father to Mother and ORDER immediate make-up visitation with the Minor Child A.K. and Mother.\nFinally, Father wishes to highlight that until Mother’s own behavior changes – until she makes consistent efforts to show up, to participate in counseling, and to obey the court-ordered schedules – progress will remain slow. The reunification process is not a one-sided obligation on Father; it requires Mother’s active participation and reliability, which have been sorely lacking.\nNecessity of Holding Mother Accountable Going Forward\nFather respectfully submits that Allegation 15 is meritless and should be denied in its entirety. The accusation of parental alienation and blocking therapy is thoroughly disproven by the documented facts and history above. Instead, the evidence shows Mother has repeatedly failed to fulfill her court-ordered responsibilities (attendance at weekly reunification dinners, involvement in the children’s appointments and activities, timely engagement in therapy, etc.), and those failures – not any misconduct by Father – have stalled the reunification progress.\nIf anyone is in contempt of court orders regarding visitation and reunification, the evidence points to Mother, not Father. By missing over half of the ordered visitations and neglecting the vast majority of A.K.’s important events, Mother has deprived herself of chances to rebuild trust with A.K.. By failing to stay for entire sessions or communicate transparently with the reunification therapist, Mother contributed to the therapist’s frustration and withdrawal. By objecting to Father’s motion to appoint a new counselor, Mother delayed the re-start of joint therapy that might have helped mend their relationship in 2025. In short, Mother has not demonstrated the commitment necessary to reassure A.K. or to cooperate in reunification.\nFather maintains that he stands ready to facilitate and encourage any and all contact between Mother and A.K. that is in A.K.’s best interest. He has proven this through his actions over the last two years. Father is not the obstacle here. However, Father is also cognizant that forcing A.K. into visits with a reluctant Mother, without Mother doing the foundational work to repair their bond, could be counterproductive. As Judge Perryman wisely noted, “Y’all get a chance to start over every single day… don’t screw your child up because she’s awesome.”. Father has taken that message to heart – he is striving to do this the right way, by prioritizing A.K.’s emotional safety while steadily encouraging more interaction.\nUntil Mother is held accountable and begins to demonstrate a consistent commitment to A.K.’s life and the court’s directives, this pattern is likely to continue. Father urges the Court to require Mother to actually exercise her visitation (attend the dinners, show up for the appointments, come to the games) and to actively participate in reunification therapy when it resumes. If Mother fails to do so, such failures should carry consequences, because A.K. cannot be coerced back into a relationship by one parent alone – it requires Mother’s genuine effort and presence.\nIn conclusion, Father refutes Allegation 15 and asks that the Court recognize the substantial evidence of his compliance and Mother’s non-compliance. The solution here is not to punish Father for imaginary “alienation,” but rather to hold Mother to her obligations so that A.K. can gradually feel secure and rebuild trust in her. Father remains, as ever, willing to support reunification in any reasonable manner. He prays that the Court will likewise encourage Mother to take responsibility for her part. Only when Mother consistently shows up – in person and in good faith – can the reunification truly move forward.\nSupported by: Motion for Reunification Counselor (Feb. 14, 2025); Second Amendment to Counter-Petition for Contempt (detailing Mother’s missed visits); Transcript of July 31, 2024 hearing (Judge Perryman); Order of July 24, 2025 (Judge Hall); Affidavit of C. McGregor (Nov. 2025); Reunification Dinner Logs and Texts (Exhibits A–D); Medical Appointment Attendance Log (Exhibit E); Kelly Turner email of Feb. 14, 2025 (Exhibit N); and other record evidence cited herein. The facts overwhelmingly show Father’s compliance and Mother’s default, not the other way around. Father respectfully requests that Allegation 15 be dismissed on the merits, and that the Court instead take under advisement the need for enforcement of Mother’s compliance with the existing orders going forward.\nResponse to Allegation No. 16 – Denial of Disregard for Court Authority; Abuse of Process; Request for Protective Relief and Fees\nMother alleges that Father has disregarded this Court’s authority. That allegation is false, unsupported, and unfounded. At no time has this Court found Father in contempt for disobedience of any order, nor has Mother produced competent evidence establishing willful noncompliance by Father. Repeating accusations without proof does not convert them into facts.\nA. Father Has Not Disregarded This Court’s Authority\nFather has consistently complied with the Court’s orders, appeared for hearings, followed visitation directives, participated in counseling when ordered, and sought clarification from the Court when conflicting or ambiguous orders existed. Where disputes arose, Father addressed them through proper motions, not unilateral action. The Court’s repeated refusal to find Father in contempt speaks for itself.\nBy contrast, Mother’s filings repeatedly rely on inflammatory conclusions rather than evidence, and often recycle allegations previously rejected or rendered moot by later orders.\nB. Mother’s Pattern of Using Litigation as a Weapon\nMother has openly stated on multiple occasions that she intends to continue filing actions against Father “for 18 years,” meaning until the children reach adulthood. Video evidence exists documenting these statements. This is not lawful advocacy; it is an admission of intent to use the court system as a weapon rather than a forum for good-faith dispute resolution.\nThis pattern has resulted in extensive and unnecessary legal fees incurred by Father, particularly related to holiday visitation filings that were avoidable and not supported by the underlying facts.\nC. Thanksgiving Pickup – Evidence of Mother’s Own Failure to Engage\nDuring the Thanksgiving pickup referenced by Mother:\nFather was inside the home.\nA family friend walked the children, including A.K., outside.\nMother’s father was present with her.\nMother never exited the vehicle, never spoke to A.K., never asked her to come with her, and never attempted to engage her.\nMother remained in the driveway for approximately 15 minutes without making any effort to exercise visitation with A.K.\nThis incident directly contradicts Mother’s narrative that Father obstructs visitation. Father cannot be blamed for Mother’s decision to remain in her vehicle and not speak to her child.\nD. Christmas Conduct – Demonstrated Good Faith by Father\nMother did not provide A.K. a single Christmas gift, card, or acknowledgment. This was the third consecutive Christmas in which Mother gave A.K. nothing.\nBy contrast:\nFather arranged for professional photographs of the children.\nThe children helped build and present Mother with a large framed portrait of themselves during the Christmas exchange.\nFather purchased gifts for A.K. and Bennett to give to their step-siblings and sibling.\nFather facilitated and encouraged all holiday interactions.\nThese facts are verifiable and directly undermine claims of alienation or hostility by Father.\nE. Mother’s Ongoing Financial Noncompliance\nMother is currently approximately $3,000 (about 4.5 months) behind in child support, in direct violation of this Court’s orders.\nAdditionally:\nOver the past three years, Mother has refused to pay her share of court-ordered medical expenses, now exceeding $3,000.\nMother has refused to contribute to school expenses.\nOver two years of weekly court-ordered meals, Mother has paid only twice.\nMother routinely fails to pay for the children’s food during her visitation, including situations where she orders food for her stepchildren but waits for Father to arrive before ordering food for Bennett.\nThis is a documented pattern of noncompliance, not isolated oversight.\nF. Reunification Therapy Was Not Blocked by Father\nMother’s claim that Father “successfully blocked reunification therapy” is demonstrably false. The record reflects that:\nFather complied with the reunification therapy order.\nFather made the child available.\nThe reunification counselor conducted only two sessions and then unilaterally withdrew.\nFather promptly filed motions seeking clarification and appointment of a new counselor.\nTherapy stalled due to factors outside Father’s control, not obstruction by Father.\nG. Requested Relief\nGiven the above, Father respectfully requests that the Court:\nReject Allegation No. 16 as unsupported and unfounded.\nFind that Mother has engaged in a pattern of abusive litigation conduct and misuse of the court process.\nEnter a protective order limiting repetitive, duplicative, or bad-faith filings absent leave of court or a certification of new, material facts.\nOrder Mother to pay Father’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, particularly those associated with holiday visitation litigation necessitated by her conduct.\nAddress Mother’s child support arrearage and unpaid medical expenses.\nAdmonish Mother that continued use of the court system as a weapon against Father and A.K. will not be tolerated.\nFather has respected this Court’s authority at every stage. What threatens the integrity of these proceedings is not Father’s conduct, but Mother’s continued pattern of unsupported allegations, repeated filings, and refusal to comply with existing orders.\nFather’s Motion for Protective Order and for Award of Attorney’s Fees\nFather, Christopher Blaine McGregor (“Father”), by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Honorable Court for entry of a Protective Order governing future filings and for an award of attorney’s fees and costs, and states as follows:\n\nI. Introduction\nThis motion is not filed lightly. It is necessitated by Mother’s repeated misuse of the court system through serial, unsupported filings, many of which recycle allegations previously addressed, clarified, or rejected by this Court. These filings have caused unnecessary financial harm to Father and emotional harm to the minor child, A.K., while diverting judicial resources from legitimate matters.\nFather has consistently complied with this Court’s orders and sought relief only through proper channels. By contrast, Mother has demonstrated a pattern of litigation conduct that is punitive in nature and untethered from the evidentiary record.\n\nII. Pattern of Abusive Litigation Conduct\nMother has filed multiple contempt and enforcement actions predicated on:\nMischaracterizations of oral rulings;\nReliance on superseded or clarified orders;\nAllegations directly contradicted by transcripts, orders, and objective evidence;\nRepackaged accusations previously resolved or rendered moot.\nOn multiple occasions, Mother has openly stated that she intends to continue filing actions against Father “for 18 years,” meaning until the children reach adulthood. Video evidence exists documenting these statements. This is not advocacy in good faith; it is an admission of intent to use litigation as a weapon rather than as a means of resolving legitimate disputes.\nThis pattern has forced Father to repeatedly incur legal fees to defend against allegations that lack factual or legal support.\n\nIII. Harm to the Minor Child\nMother’s conduct has not only harmed Father financially, but has also adversely affected A.K. The repeated litigation, accusations, and forced exchanges have occurred despite the Court’s acknowledgment—after the in camera interview—that A.K. experiences significant emotional distress related to visitation issues.\nRather than working within the reunification framework ordered by the Court, Mother has repeatedly attempted to litigate around it, increasing conflict and instability for the child.\n\nIV. Financial Harm and Unnecessary Attorney’s Fees\nAs a direct result of Mother’s filings—particularly those related to holiday visitation—Father has incurred substantial and avoidable attorney’s fees. These filings were unnecessary, often contradicted by the record, and in some instances required solely because Mother attempted to enforce orders that had already been clarified or superseded.\nEquity and fairness require that Mother bear responsibility for the costs generated by her conduct.\n\nV. Mother’s Ongoing Noncompliance with Court Orders\nWhile repeatedly accusing Father of contempt, Mother herself remains in violation of multiple court orders, including:\nChild Support: Mother is approximately $3,000 (4.5 months) in arrears.\nMedical Expenses: Mother has refused for more than three years to pay her share of court-ordered medical expenses, now exceeding $3,000.\nCourt-Ordered Meals: Over two years of weekly court-ordered meals, Mother has paid only twice.\nGeneral Support: Mother has refused to contribute to school expenses or routine costs.\nThis imbalance—where one party repeatedly accuses while refusing to comply—underscores the need for judicial intervention to prevent further abuse of process.\n\nVI. Legal Basis for Protective Relief\nAlabama courts possess inherent authority to:\nPrevent abuse of the judicial process;\nLimit repetitive or bad-faith filings;\nAward attorney’s fees where equity demands.\nA narrowly tailored protective order is appropriate where a party demonstrates a pattern of vexatious or harassing litigation conduct, particularly in domestic relations cases involving minor children.\nFather is not seeking to bar Mother from legitimate access to the Court. He seeks only reasonable safeguards to ensure future filings are made in good faith and based on material, verifiable facts.\n\nVII. Requested Relief\nFather respectfully requests that the Court enter an order:\nIssuing a Protective Litigation Order, such that any future contempt or enforcement filings by Mother must:\nBe based on new, material facts not previously litigated; and\nInclude a certification of good-faith factual basis; or\nAlternatively, require leave of Court before filing_plugin\nAwarding Father reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including but not limited to those incurred in responding to Mother’s holiday visitation filings and repeated contempt motions.\nAddressing Mother’s child support and medical expense arrearages and ordering compliance forthwith.\nAdmonishing Mother that continued misuse of the court system as a means of harassment or leverage will not be tolerated.\nGranting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nFather has respected this Court’s authority at every stage. What threatens the integrity of these proceedings is not Father’s conduct, but Mother’s continued pattern of unsupported allegations, repetitive filings, and refusal to comply with existing orders while invoking the Court as a punitive tool.\nA protective order and fee award are necessary to restore balance, protect the minor child, and ensure that future litigation—if any—is undertaken responsibly and in good faith.",
