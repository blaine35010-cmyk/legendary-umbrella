This is Kelly Turner. Blaine I\nam the therapist that will be doing the reunification therapy\nper the court recommendations. We had our first session\nyesterday scheduled. Sorry that missed AK. We will have our\nnext session on 9/4 at 3:00.\nPlease reply Y to confirm .\n8/20/2024 9:10 AM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nHi Kelly! We don’t have a court order as of yet & some of the\ndetails are actually still being worked through.\nI’ve been very clear with Brittany that the reunification\ntherapist we select should have no prior history with either AK\nor Brittany.\nWe have to work together in scheduling these appointments\nas Addie Kate can’t miss school once per week. I also need to\nwork around both kids school related activities, extracurricular\nactivities, arranging pickups for Bennett, & I also have a full\ntime job that I have to consider as well.\n8/20/2024 9:18 AM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nI also informed Brittany last week that until we decide on a RT\nthat she shouldn’t make any appointments. Additionally AK &\nBennett are sick & they had doctors appointments yesterday\nat 4pm. I informed Brittany about the appointments yesterday\nmorning. Don’t want you to think that all of this wasn’t\ncommunicated to Brittany prior to yesterday’s appointment.\n8/20/2024 9:24 AM (Viewed 8/20/2024 9:25 AM)\n3346180033\nShe did mention the kids were sick hope everyone is feeling\nbetter\nHowever I did want to set up the next session to get this going\nas I’ve have seen the summation/ recommendations from\ncourt although we are waiting on the final order.\nOnce we are established we can shoot for 4:00 sessions to\navoid missing school . Thank you .\n1\n8/20/2024 9:28 AM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nOnce we have confirmation from the court & have selected\na therapist we can setup the sessions. Again, I think it’s best\nto select a RT that neither have history with & that’s local to\nour area as traveling an hr each way every week is going to be\ndifficult.\n8/20/2024 9:30 AM (Viewed 8/20/2024 5:32 PM)\n3346180033\nWe do not have a history that I’m aware of so no issue there.\n8/20/2024 9:32 AM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nNo sessions with Brittany prior to starting the RT? I’ve asked\nBrittany a few times but she hasn’t responded.\n11/12/2024 4:57 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nHi Kelly!\nAK has an existing appointment for comprehension, that we’ve\nwaited weeks for. Brittany was informed of this appointment\nseveral weeks ago & reminded about it just a few days ago.\nBrittany purposely scheduled the RT appointment at the\nsame time as her behavioral appointment so I would be in\ncontempt.\nIs there any other time between now and then that would\nwork?\nIt’s very critical that Addie Kate go to her appointment.\nI’ve expressed to Brittany that I’m 100% flexible & will have her\nthere but please schedule anytime other than the time of AKs\nexisting appointment.\n2\n11/12/2024 4:59 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\n3\n11/12/2024 4:59 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\n11/12/2024 5:19 PM\n3346180033\nI can’t go thru this what is it\n11/12/2024 5:20 PM\n3346180033\nIf you need to send attachments or anything for me to read\nplease send to my email\nMy email\nIs\nThebridges12@gmail.com\n11/12/2024 5:21 PM\n3346180033\nHere is my new work cell number\nPlease contact me thru it or email\n334-442-0112\n4\nThank you\n11/12/2024 5:21 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nMessage was edited 11/12/2024 5:22 PM\nThank you!
