Does the family court & the judge that handles our case handle the child support as\nwell since it's with DHR now? Sorry, it's so confusing.\nShe amended a contempt filing we have court for on Oct. 17th to include child support modification because of an issue of\nnon-payment to her for equity division as it's tied up in the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court has jurisdiction on that\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ik=b1896004a3&view=pt&search=all&permthid=thread-f:1810025883150175237&simpl=msg-f:181002588315017… 13/15\n9/27/25, 4:40 PM Gmail - Proposed Orders\nmatter so it's nothing I can do about the non-payment. The payments were $2000 per month for 24 months. Does that\nconstitute a change to allow for modification? I also know but want to make sure that the equity payment of $2000 per\nmonth was included in the calculation on top of her income from her current job. She states it was included & that's why\nshe wants a modification. Based on my memory her income was calculated at $20 per hour because that's what she was\nmaking at the time. I think she makes $26 now.\nSorry for so many questions!
