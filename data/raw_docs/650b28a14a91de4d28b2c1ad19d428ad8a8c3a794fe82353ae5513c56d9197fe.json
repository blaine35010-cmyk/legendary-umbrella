Gilliland Visitation\nDianne--\nAs you are aware, on June 18, 2025, the judge specifically ordered Blaine to follow with the final order of divorce, which the parties\nhad been doing, albeit amended slightly for summer visitation, since summer started. The June 18th order specifically references\nthe visitation of the final order, meaning the divorce order, and therefore, your interpretation of it being any other orders is\nincorrect. The judge issued another order on July 24, 2025, in reference to Addie Kate, stating for Blaine not to let Addie Kate\nchoose if she wants to exercise visitation with her mom.\nBlaine is stating that he refuses to comply, please see the text messages attached. Please remind him of what the judge has\nordered.\nBrittany will be there on the 7th of August to exchange both children for her visitation. She would also like to request that she be\nable to see the kids off for their first day of school, if possible. Please let me know. Thank you.\nAriabel Barjis\nLegal Assistant\nAgricola Law\n7.24.25 Order on Final Order.pdf, 6.19.25 Order on CS and Visitation.pdf, IMG_5039.pdf\nBlaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 9:30 AM\nTo: Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>, Traci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com>, Darlene Meadows\n<billing@diannedavislaw.com>\nDo we need to ask the judge for clarification? The order stating the final order was signed by the judge on 6.19 - The\nlatest order signed by the judge on 7.24 states follow orders.\nWe have a temporary order in place until the final hearing. The purpose of this temporary order was to do away with\nforcing Visits with AK, moved the dinners to Sunday, & visitation for Bennett Friday to Monday.\nThey can't pick & choose out of which order they want to go with.\nBarbi & Brittany agreed to this in court which allowed us to settle on that temporary order until final hearing.\nWhere do we go from here?\n[Quoted text hidden]\nTraci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 9:54 AM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nI have printed this email for Dianne, along with the email from Barbie’s assistant, and your email from yesterday with the attachments. I know\nthis is terribly upsetting, Blaine and I understand.

I'm upset that we agreed to this temporary order & now Brittany/Barbi always try to find\nloopholes etc... it's BS\n[Quoted text hidden]\nTraci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 10:03 AM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nOf course! We all understand that our clients are not angry with us but with the situation, etc. Also, you must be so frustrated. Brittany’s\nwords DO NOT match her actions with AK. She suddenly is pushing for visitation but has nothing to do with AK! Dianne should be here\nsoon.\n[Quoted text hidden]\nBlaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 11:01 AM\nTo: Traci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com>\nYea, very frustrated but not at yall! Love you all to death! I honestly don't think I would be in this position had I started\nwith yall! :)\nIt's just draining financially & mentally.... Brittany doesn't truly want AK to visit... She uses AK as leverage in all\nareas... Getting me in trouble, trying to get more time with Bennett... etc...\nBrittany doesn't even have a place for AK to sleep. They have a 2 bedroom house with Bennett, the baby, & Bradley's\n2 girls.. I know it's not the point because if Brittany had a good relationship with AK it wouldn't matter but still she\nneeds to have AK a space to sleep in my opinion.\n[Quoted text hidden]\nTraci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 11:27 AM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nI believe Dianne is going to call you today.\n[Quoted text hidden]\nDianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 3:16 PM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nPlease see Dianne’s email to Aria, below.\nTraci Sinclair\nParalegal to Dianne James Davis\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, AL 35010\n(256) 392-3172 (Phone)\n(256) 392-3578 (Fax)\nparalegal@diannedavislaw.com\nFrom: Dianne Davis\nSent: Thursday, July 31, 2025 3:16 PM\nTo: 'Aria Barjis' <aria@agricolalaw.com>\nSubject: RE: McGregor v. Gilliland Visitation\nBelow is Dianne’s response to your email of 7.30.25.\nThe order of July 24, 2025 is where the judge referenced the “orders”. This is a .01 case and these are\norders from that case pertaining to Addie Kate and Bennett. The order regarding Bennett, the days were changed\nbecause of school and Brittany moving, without notice, over two hours away round trip.\nI was told that at the last family dinner when Blaine met Brittany in Prattville because she could not even make\nit here, Brittany would not even sit at the same table with them. Addie Kate asked her mom to sit with them but she\nrefused. I find that strange for a mother who is trying to reconnect with her daughter.\nWe are of the opinion that the Court is referring to all the orders in the .01 case. Be assured that Blaine has\ndone everything to get Addie Kate to visit with her mom.\n[Quoted text hidden]\nBlaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com> Thu, Jul 31 at 3:19 PM\nTo: Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>\nThank you!\n[Quoted text hidden]\nBlaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com> Fri, Aug 1 at 12:11 PM\nTo: Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>, Darlene Meadows <billing@diannedavislaw.com>, Traci Sinclair\n<paralegal@diannedavislaw.com>\nGood Morning!\nDid they respond or have you heard anything?\nBrittany hasn't responded about getting Bennett today.\nThanks,\nBlaine\n[Quoted text hidden]\nDarlene Meadows <billing@diannedavislaw.com> Fri, Aug 1 at 12:24 PM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>, Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>, Traci Sinclair\n<paralegal@diannedavislaw.com>\nNo, they have not to me and nothing has been filed.\nDarlene\nFrom: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, August 1, 2025 12:12 PM\nTo: Dianne Davis <dianne@diannedavislaw.com>; Darlene Meadows <billing@diannedavislaw.com>;\nTraci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com>\nSubject: Re: FW: McGregor v.

If we don't, they will file contempt on\nme next Thursday when they claim her visitation starts.\nAlso, Brittany refuses to answer about Sunday Dinners.. So I'm in limbo... If they are ignoring the temp order that\nchanged the dinners to Sunday & going off the final decree there are no Dinners listed in our Decree.\nI asked Brittany Wednesday & Today to let me know what time Sunday for Dinner - But she hasn't responded\n[Quoted text hidden]\nTraci Sinclair <paralegal@diannedavislaw.com> Fri, Aug 1 at 1:56 PM\nTo: Blaine McGregor <blaine35010@gmail.com>\nShe ignores orders yet insists that certain parts of other orders be followed.
