(Doc. 51). This matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§\n157 and 1334. The Court reviewed the pleadings and record, and for reasons set forth\nherein OVERRULES the Objection as to timeliness, SUSTAINS the Objection as to\nclassification, and RECLASSIFIES Claim No. 19 as a general unsecured claim.\nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND OVERVIEW OF FACTS\nDebtor filed a Chapter 13 petition on September 20, 2024. (Doc. 1). Debtor\nscheduled a nonpriority unsecured claim in the amount of $32,000 in favor of his ex-wife,\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland (“Creditor”). (Doc. 1, p. 21). The deadline for filings proofs\nof claim was November 29, 2024 (the “Bar Date”). (Doc. 7).\nOn December 2, 2024, Creditor filed Claim No. 19 as a priority unsecured claim in\nthe amount of $30,000 for a domestic support obligation under 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(1)(A)\nor (a)(1)(B), and, shortly thereafter, amended the claim amount to $32,000 (the “Claim”).\n(Claim 19-1; Claim 19-2). Debtor filed the Objection, asserting that the Claim should be\ndisallowed because it was filed three days after the Bar Date. (Doc. 51). Alternatively,\nDebtor argues that, if allowed, the Claim should be treated as a general unsecured claim\nbecause the Claim “is not in the nature of support, [and] therefore not a domestic support\nobligation.” Id. In response, Creditor contends that the Claim was timely filed “because\nMonday, December 2, 2024, the date Creditor’s Proof of Claim was filed, was the next\nbusiness day following November 29, 2024, a state holiday” which is a legal holiday under\nRule 9006(a)(6)(C) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. (Doc. 52). Creditor\n1\nCase 24-81152 Doc 73 Filed 09/05/25 Entered 09/05/25 15:38:00 Desc Main\nDocument Page 1 of 6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 1-2 Filed 09/09/25 Page 2 of 6\nalso asserts that the Claim is entitled “to first priority and [is] nondischargeable.”1 (Doc.\n52).\nII. LEGAL ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nThis matter requires resolution of two issues. First, the Court must determine\nwhether the Claim was timely filed under Rule 9006. If the Court determines that the\nClaim is untimely, the Court need not address the second issue as the Claim would be\ndisallowed. If, however, the Claim is deemed timely, the Court must then determine\nwhether the Claim is entitled to priority status as a domestic support obligation or, instead,\nshould be classified as a general unsecured claim. A properly filed proof of claim\nconstitutes prima facie evidence of both the validity and amount of the claim. FED. R.\nBANKR. P. 3001(f). Debtor, as the objecting party, bears the initial burden of producing\nsufficient evidence to rebut this presumption, thereafter, the ultimate burden of persuasion\nshifts back to Creditor. See In re Watson, 606 Fed Appx. 543 (11th Cir. 2015); In re\nBarron, 325 B.R. 17, 20 (Bankr. M.D. Ala. 2005).\na. Timeliness of the Claim\nRule 3002(c), together with Rule 9006 and Rule 502(b)(9), generally prohibit the\nfiling of late claims except under the specific circumstances set forth in Rule 3002(c). Rule\n9006(a)(1) governs the computation of time unless a different method is specified. Under\nRule 9006(a)(1), if the last day of the filing period falls on a legal holiday, the deadline is\nextended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. FED. R. BANKR.\nP. 9006(a)(1)(C). Rule 9006(a)(6) defines a “legal holiday” as:\n(A) the day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Birthday of\nMartin Luther King Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth\nNational Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day,\nVeteran's Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day;\n(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress; and\n(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a\nholiday by the state where the district court is located. (In this rule, “state”\nincludes the District of Columbia and any United States commonwealth or\nterritory.)\n1 Whether the Claim is nondischargeable is not properly before the Court, and the Court will not address that issue.\n2\nCase 24-81152 Doc 73 Filed 09/05/25 Entered 09/05/25 15:38:00 Desc Main\nDocument Page 2 of 6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 1-2 Filed 09/09/25 Page 3 of 6\nFED. R. BANKR. P. 9006(a)(6) (emphasis added). The purpose of Rule 9006(a)(6)(C),\nwhich includes state holidays as “legal holidays,” is to protect against unintended late\nfilings when a filer might assume courts are closed due to a state holiday. See FED. R.\nBANKR. P. 9006, Advisory Comm. Note (2009).\nDebtor asserts that the Claim should be disallowed as it was filed three days after\nthe Bar Date. (Doc. 51, ¶ 5). Creditor argues that the Claim was not untimely as Governor\nIvey “declared November 29, 2024, the day after Thanksgiving, a state holiday.” (Doc.\n52). The Governor’s Memorandum, dated May 20, 2024, authorized Thursday, November\n28, 2024, and Friday, November 29, 2024, as state holidays. (Creditor’s Ex. 2). Debtor\nargues that the Proclamation issued by Governor Ivey designated only November 28, 2024,\nnot November 29, 2024, as the legal holiday. (Debtor’s Ex. 2). Debtor also cites to Ala.\nCode § 1-3-8(a), which delegates to the governor the authority to designate a single day for\nThanksgiving.\nSection 1-3-8(a) provides that, in addition to enumerated statutory holidays, “the\nday designated by the Governor for public thanksgiving” shall be deemed a legal holiday.\nId. While Debtor is correct that the statute refers to “the day designated by the Governor\nfor public thanksgiving” in the singular, the statute also authorizes the Governor to\ndesignate additional holidays. ALA. CODE. § 1-3-8(d) (authorizing state banks to close “on\nsuch other days as may be declared by the Governor to be state holidays in honor of a\nspecial event.”) (emphasis added). Governor Ivey’s Memorandum did precisely that by\nextending the holiday to include both Thursday, November 28, 2024, and Friday,\nNovember 29, 2024. Thus, November 29, 2024, was a legal holiday under Alabama law.\nAccordingly, the Court concludes that November 29, 2024, was a legal holiday\nunder Rule 9006(a)(6)(C), and the Bar Date was extended to the next business day,\nMonday, December 2, 2024. Thus, the Claim is timely.\nb. Classification of the Claim\nHaving determined that the Claim is timely, the Court must next consider whether\nthe Claim—arising from a monetary obligation imposed by the parties’ Final Decree of\nDivorce (the “Divorce Decree”) entered into by the Circuit Court of Tallapoosa County,\n3\nCase 24-81152 Doc 73 Filed 09/05/25 Entered 09/05/25 15:38:00 Desc Main\nDocument Page 3 of 6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 1-2 Filed 09/09/25 Page 4 of 6\nAlabama (the “Circuit Court”)—qualifies as a “domestic support obligation” entitled to\npriority status under § 507(a)(1)(A) or a general unsecured debt resulting from a division\nof property. Under § 101(14A), a “domestic support obligation” refers to a debt, in the\nnature of alimony, maintenance, or support, owed to or recoverable by a spouse, former\nspouse, child, or governmental unit, arising from a court order, divorce decree, or\nseparation agreement. 11 U.S.C. § 101(14A). Section 507(a)(1)(A) “provide[s] a priority\nclaim for domestic support obligations.” In re Hause, 2015 WL 7251662, at *2 (Bankr.\nM.D. Fla. Nov. 13, 2015) (internal citation omitted). Unless a divorce-related obligation\nqualifies as a “domestic support obligation” under § 101(14A), it does not receive priority\nstatus; instead, it is classified with other general unsecured claims. See Cummings v.\nCummings, 244 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir. 2001).\nWhether a debt is a “domestic support obligation” within the meaning of § 101(14A)\nis determined under federal bankruptcy law. In re Colin, 546 B.R. 455, 458 (Bankr. M.D.\nAla. 2016) (citing Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1265). Yet “state law provides guidance in\ndetermining whether an obligation should be considered ‘support[.]’” Id. (internal citations\nomitted). Because “it is likely that neither the parties nor the divorce court contemplated\nthe effect of a subsequent bankruptcy when the obligation arose[,]” courts must look\nbeyond labels and examine the substance of the obligation rather than its form to determine\nwhether the debt is in the nature of support or alimony. Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1265\n(internal citations omitted); see also In re Colin, 546 B.R. at 458; In re Saggus, 528 B.R.\n452, 457 (Bankr. M.D. Ala. 2015). When deciding whether an obligation is in the nature\nof support or alimony, a bankruptcy court must consider the intent of the parties or the\ndivorce court, as reflected in a settlement agreement or divorce judgment. Cummings, 244\nF.3d at 1266; see also In re Santry, 481 B.R. 824, 829 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2012) (noting that\n“the intentions of the divorce court or, if a settlement, the parties when the obligation was\ncreated are of primary importance” in determining whether a debt owed is in the nature of\nsupport). Here, the Divorce Decree does not incorporate a marital settlement agreement\nby the parties and there was no evidence offered to support that the terms of the Divorce\nDecree were the result of a consensual agreement between the parties. As a result, the\n4\nCase 24-81152 Doc 73 Filed 09/05/25 Entered 09/05/25 15:38:00 Desc Main\nDocument Page 4 of 6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 1-2 Filed 09/09/25 Page 5 of 6\nCourt finds that the language of the Divorce Decree best reflects the intentions of the\nCircuit Court. See Cummings, 244 F.3d at 1266.\nLooking to the language of the Divorce Decree, Paragraph 7 provides that Debtor is\nto pay Creditor the sum of $51,411.21 (the “Obligation”), representing “one-half (1/2) of\nthe equity in the residence[.]” (Doc. 52, Ex. 1, at ¶ 7) (emphasis added). Debtor could\nsatisfy the Obligation by either paying an initial $10,000 lump sum within ten days of the\nentry of the Divorce Decree followed by twenty-one monthly installments of $2,000, or by\nmaking a lump-sum payment in full within ninety days. Id. Once the Obligation is paid in\nfull, Creditor is obligated to execute a “Quit Claim Deed” transferring her interest in the\nresidence to Debtor. (Doc. 52, Ex. 1, at ¶ 6). Thus, the Obligation is complete upon\npayment in full by Debtor and not upon any contingency, such as remarriage by Creditor.\nThe Divorce Decree also provides a remedy in the event of nonpayment of the\nObligation by Debtor—specifically, sale of the residence and equal division of the\nproceeds. (Doc. 52, Ex. 1, at ¶ 7). The Divorce Decree does not authorize enforcement\nthrough contempt, permit modification, or describe the Obligation in terms typically\nassociated with support. In re Davison, 2014 WL 6674770, at *3 (Bankr. M.D. Ala. Nov.\n24, 2014) (“Under Alabama state law, alimony is modifiable, but a property settlement in\na divorce is not modifiable.”).\nAdditionally, the Divorce Decree expressly states that “[n]either party is ordered to\npay alimony.” (Doc. 52, Ex. 1, at ¶ 23). Unlike attributes of support, the language in\nParagraph 7 sets forth a reciprocal exchange: Creditor receives a fixed sum representing\nher share of the equity in the residence, and in return, she must relinquish her interest in\nthe residence upon full payment of the Obligation. Id. The amount is precisely calculated\nbased on the value and equity in the residence, and it is not based on any assessment of\nCreditor’s financial needs. Further, there is no suggestion in the Divorce Decree that the\nObligation was intended to provide for Creditor’s living expenses or subsistence. At the\nevidentiary hearing, Creditor testified that she relied on the monthly payments to meet her\nfinancial obligations. However, Creditor’s post hoc reliance does not control the\nclassification. Moreover, the Divorce Decree separately provides for child support to be\n5\nCase 24-81152 Doc 73 Filed 09/05/25 Entered 09/05/25 15:38:00 Desc Main\nDocument Page 5 of 6\nCase 3:25-cv-00721-BL Document 1-2 Filed 09/09/25 Page 6 of 6\npaid by Creditor to Debtor—suggesting that any obligation of support ran in the opposite\ndirection. (Doc. 52, Ex. 1, at ¶ 16). Lastly, it is also persuasive that the Divorce Decree\nallocated all remaining debts and assets to the individual parties, severing any ongoing\nfinancial interdependence. Id., at ¶¶ 19–20.\nHere, there is no indication in the Divorce Decree that the Circuit Court intended\nthe Obligation to function as support for Creditor. Accordingly, the Court concludes that\nthe Obligation is not a domestic support obligation, but a property settlement; thus, the\nClaim is not entitled to priority treatment.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the Court OVERRULES the Objection as to\ntimeliness, SUSTAINS the Objection as to classification, and RECLASSIFIES the Claim\nas a general unsecured claim.\nDone this 5th day of September, 2025.\nBess M.
