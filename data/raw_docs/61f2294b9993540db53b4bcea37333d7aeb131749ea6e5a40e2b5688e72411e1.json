We also need to address the issue as required in item # 2, due to the\nfact that we both discovered that the Child Advocacy Center will not counsel with your\nclient. It may become necessary for our clients to jointly agree on another counselor so\nthat a joint session between A.K. and Ms. Gilliland can take place. And last, as\ndiscussed, there is no insurance that covers counseling within the health insurance\npolicy presently held by my client. That will be another matter that we need to discuss\nbriefly to determine how the cost of counselling will be covered. In item # 6, do you think\nit may be a good idea to be less specific about Wednesday night so that conflicts in our\nclient’s schedule and A.K.’s schedule will not prevent said weekly dinners.\nI look forward to talking to you about these matters as soon as possible.\nSincerely,\nTOM F. YOUNG, JR.\nTFY/cc",
