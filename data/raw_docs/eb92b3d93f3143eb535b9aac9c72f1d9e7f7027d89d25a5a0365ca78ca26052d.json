(DOB: 05/10/2019), every other weekend from Friday after school\nuntil Monday morning, at which time the child was to be returned to school or to\nthe Father.\n2) That pursuant to the Court’s Final Decree of Divorce entered on the 27th day of\nFebruary, 2024, the Mother was awarded certain visitation periods with both\nminor children, including the 1st and 3rd full weeks of June and July.\n3) That for some time, the minor child, A.K.M. (DOB: 05/24/2012), has not\nexercised visitation with the Defendant/Mother due to emotional or relational\nissues she has experienced with her mother. Furthermore, at a prior hearing, the\nCourt ordered that visitation between A.K.M. and the Defendant/Mother would be\nsuspended pending counseling for the child. Due to A.K.M.’s age, the Father\nrequests that she be allowed to visit the Mother at her own discretion.\nDOCUMENT 202\n4) That several months ago, the Mother relocated to Clanton, Chilton County,\nAlabama. The travel time between the Mother’s new residence and Alexander\nCity is approximately 1.15 hours.\n5) That as a result of the relocation, the minor child, B.M., is now required to travel\nbetween Alexander City and Clanton every other weekend, which is\napproximately a 2.30-hour drive round trip. During summer and holiday\nvisitation periods, both children are subject to the same travel demands.\n6) That the frequent travel, particularly on alternating weekends, has become\nincreasingly burdensome on the minor child, B.M., and is no longer in his best\ninterest.\n7) That the Father asserts a modification of the current visitation schedule is\nwarranted in light of the Mother’s relocation in order to reduce the strain on the\nminor child and to promote his stability and well-being.\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Plaintiff/Father respectfully requests\nthat this Honorable Court modify the Defendant/Mother’s visitation schedule to account for the\nincreased travel demands resulting from her relocation and to serve the best interest of the minor\nchild, B.M. Plaintiff/Father further requests that the minor child, A.K.M., be allowed to visit\nwith the Mother at her own discretion. The Plaintiff/Father requests all such other relief to\nwhich he may be entitled, the premises considered.\nRespectfully submitted this the 27th day of June, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, AL 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nDOCUMENT 202\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing with the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of the same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 27th day of June, 2025.\nBarbara H.
