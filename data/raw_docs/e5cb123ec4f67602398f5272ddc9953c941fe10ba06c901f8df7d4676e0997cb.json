members of\nthe Association of Family and Conciliation Courts (AFCC) and others who provide\ntreatment to court-involved children and families. The Guidelines are also intended to\nassist those who rely on mental health services or on the opinions of mental health\nprofessionals in promoting effective treatment and assessing the quality of treatment\nservices. The Guidelines are also intended to assist the Courts to develop clear and\neffective Court orders and parenting plans that may be necessary for treatment to be\neffective.\nAFCC does not intend these Guidelines to define mandatory practice. They are a best-\npractice guide for therapists, attorneys, other professionals and judicial officers when\nthere is a need for therapeutic interventions with court-involved children or parents.\nWhile available resources and local jurisdictional expectations may influence the types of\ntherapeutic services provided by a Court-Involved Therapist (CIT), the purpose of these\nguidelines is to educate, highlight common concerns, and to apply relevant ethical and\nprofessional guidelines, standards, and research in handling court-involved families.\nINTRODUCTION\nFor the purposes of these guidelines, court-involved therapists are mental health\nprofessionals who provide therapeutic services to family members involved in child\ncustody or juvenile dependency Court processes. Family and juvenile Court cases\ninvolving therapeutic services introduce unique factors and dynamics that require\nconsideration in the treatment process. Both the treatment process and information\nprovided to the therapist are likely to be influenced by the family’s involvement in a legal\nprocess. While appropriate treatment can offer considerable benefit to children and\nfamilies, inappropriate treatment may escalate family conflict and cause significant\ndamage.\nThe Guidelines for Court-Involved Therapy are the product of the Court-Involved\nTherapist Task Force, appointed by AFCC President Robin Deutsch in 2009. Task force\nmembers were: Hon. Linda S. Fidnick, Co-Chair; Matthew Sullivan, Ph.D., Co-Chair;\nLyn R. Greenberg, Ph.D., Reporter; Paul Berman, Ph.D.; Christopher Barrows, J.D.;\nHon. R. John Harper; Hon. Anita Josey-Herring; Mindy Mitnick, M.Ed., M.A.; and Hon.\nGail Perlman.\n1\nDEFINITIONS\nA. Definitions Regarding Professional Roles\nCommunity Therapist: Any mental health professional providing psychotherapeutic\ntreatment of a parent, child, couple or family who is not involved with the legal system at\nany time during the treatment.\nCourt-Involved Therapist (CIT): Any mental health professional providing\npsychotherapeutic treatment of a parent, child, couple or family who is, at any time\nduring the treatment, involved with the legal system.\nCourt-Appointed Therapist: Any mental health professional providing\npsychotherapeutic treatment of a parent, child, couple or family undertaken because the\nparticular psychotherapist was ordered by a judge to provide treatment. The Court order\ndesignates the specific psychotherapist and may describe the expected treatment.\nCourt-Ordered Therapist: Any mental health professional providing psychotherapeutic\ntreatment of a parent, child, couple or family undertaken because it was ordered by a\njudge. The Court order does not designate a specific therapist and may describe the\nexpected treatment.\nB. Definitions Regarding Experts\nExpert: The word expert generally refers to a person with specialized knowledge of a\nparticular subject matter.\nIn the legal context, the word “expert” refers to a witness who has been specifically\nqualified by the Court in a particular case to provide opinion evidence within a\ncircumscribed subject matter determined by the Court. To qualify an expert, the Court\nfirst reviews evidence of the witness’s expertise of that subject matter, unless the\nadmissibility of the professional’s opinion as an expert has been previously stipulated to\nby the parties or established by the Court.\n(a) Treating Expert: A mental health professional, who currently serves or has\nserved as the therapist for a parent, child, couple or family involved with the\nlegal system. If the therapist is qualified by the Court as an expert, testimony\nshould be limited to the therapist’s particular area of expertise and issues\ndirectly relevant to the treatment role. To the degree permitted by the Court in a\nspecific case, the treating expert can provide expert opinion regarding a parent\nor child’s psychological functioning over time, progress, relationship dynamics,\ncoping skills, development, co-parenting progress, or need for further treatment,\nas appropriate to the therapist’s role. In contrast to the forensic expert, the\ntreating expert does not have the information base or objectivity necessary to\nmake psycho-legal recommendations, such as specifying parenting plans, legal\ncustody, or decision-making authority.\n2\n(b) Mental Health Forensic Expert: A mental health professional hired by a party or\nappointed by a Court to answer a legal question through the application of\npsychological methods. A mental health forensic expert, for example, may\nperform a custody evaluation, a psychological evaluation to answer a particular\nquestion formulated by the Court, a competency evaluation, an evaluation to\nassist the Court in the decision-making process regarding custody and/or\naccess. Their testimony might include psycho-legal issues such as\nrecommendations about parenting plans, legal custody or decision-making\nauthority.\nC. General Definitions\nClient/Patient: A parent, child, couple or family receiving psychotherapeutic treatment\nfrom any of the mental health professionals defined in this section\nCollateral: A person, not a client or patient, who has information bearing on the client\nor patient and whom a mental health professional, in any role defined in this section,\ninterviews to obtain information or engages directly in the client or patient’s treatment.\nConfidentiality: An ethical duty, also established by statute, rules or case law in some\njurisdictions, owed by a mental health professional to a client/patient, subject to some\nexceptions, to maintain the client/patient’s privacy by not revealing information received\nfrom the client/patient.\nPrivilege: A legal right, conferred by statute in many jurisdictions and limited by\nexceptions, held by a mental health professional’s client/patient to prevent the mental\nhealth professional from disclosing confidential information in a legal proceeding. Some\njurisdictions have a formal process for determining whether or not and under what\ncircumstances the privilege will be waived by or on behalf of the client/patient to allow\ntestimony by the mental health professional in a court-related matter. (Issues regarding\nprivilege and confidentiality are described in Guideline 7.)\nConflict of Interest: A situation in which personal, professional, legal or other interests\nor relationships have the potential to compromise or bias the mental health professional’s\njudgment, effectiveness or objectivity. A conflict of interest may also occur in some\njurisdictions based on the establishment of an appearance of conflict standard rather than\nan actual conflict.\nInformed Consent:\n(a) A client/patient’s decision to consent to a proposed treatment or a proposed\nrelease of confidential information by a mental health professional, after the\nclient/patient has received reasonably full and accurate information from the\nmental health professional as to the risks, benefits and likely consequences of\nthe decision to consent.\n3\n(b) The term is used colloquially by mental health professionals to mean the\nprocess by which a client/patient receives the information needed to make an\ninformed decision. The process usually includes discussion and a written\nagreement between the mental health professional and the client/patient as to the\ninformation provided and the client’s understanding of it. (See Guideline 6.)\n4\nGUIDELINE 1: ASSESSING LEVELS OF COURT INVOLVEMENT\n1.1 A CIT should assess the degree to which legal processes will impact the\ntreatment and consider issues that may impact the client or parent’s\nfunctioning in treatment, and the implications of treatment interventions on\nthe legal processes\n(a) The CIT should be aware that cases may have different degrees of Court\ninvolvement, and may also change in their degree of Court involvement over\ntime.\n(b) The CIT should obtain information about how the decision to enter therapy\nwas made, who was involved in the decision, and what outcomes are expected\nfrom the treatment or the therapist by parents, other professionals, or the\nCourt.\n(c) The CIT should consider the variety of mechanisms through which court-\ninvolved families can enter treatment, and the implications of each of those\ncircumstances:\n(1) A parent involved in a Court case recognizes his/her own or child’s\ndistress and seeks treatment.\n(2) A parent seeks therapy for him/herself or a child, in hopes of\nimproving his/her own position in the Court case and securing the\ntherapist’s direct or indirect participation (report to a custody\nevaluator, etc.).\n(3) Parents are ordered to obtain therapy for themselves or a child, but\nselect from community practitioners with no specific agenda,\nreporting expectation or requirement.\n(4) The Court orders therapy to address particular issues, such as child\ndistress, high-conflict dynamics, reunification, etc. The order may\ninclude some degree of reporting requirement, or contingencies\nallowing reporting.\n(d) The CIT should consider the potential impact of Court involvement on adults’\nfunctioning in treatment. The stress of Court involvement and the importance\nof the outcome to those involved can generate conscious or unconscious\ndistortion of information and changes in the clients’ or parents’ expectations\nof the therapist.\n(e) (cid:3)(cid:3) The CIT should consider the impact of his/her natural working alliance\nwith the client. This may lead the therapist to align with the client’s position\nin the legal dispute, thus impairing the CIT’s ability to prepare the client to\ncope with likely outcomes and stresses in the legal process. While a client\nmay equate his or her best interests with prevailing in the legal dispute, CITs\nmust remain cognizant that their role is to promote successful psychological\n5\nfunctioning in the client, not to serve as an advocate or a forensic expert or\nproduce a particular outcome in the legal process.\n1.2. Special considerations for court-involved roles with children\n(a) Children’s behavior and statements may vary markedly based on the\ncircumstances of treatment.\n(b) The CIT has an enhanced obligation to consider multiple treatment hypotheses\nand be knowledgeable about children’s developmental tasks and needs.\n(c) The CIT should use particular caution to ensure that he/she has adequate data\non which to base any opinions or assessments, and to form and express such\nopinions only within confines of the therapeutic role and available\ninformation, while remaining cognizant of the impact of Court involvement\non the family and on treatment information.\n(d) The CIT must, whenever possible, obtain each parent’s perspective in the\ntreatment process and maintain professional objectivity when interpreting\nstatements and behaviors of children. The CIT should use particular caution\nin interpreting statements, play or drawings that appear to express positions on\nadult issues to avoid inaccurate or incomplete assessment of a child’s\ndevelopmental needs, expressed thoughts and feelings.\n(e) The CIT should be aware of the potential impact of parental needs and\nexpectations on treatment involving children or adolescents. The CIT should\nbe particularly aware that:\n(1) A parent may have a genuine desire to obtain treatment or provide it\nto a child, but may also have expectations that the therapy will\nsupport the parent’s own goals in the legal conflict.\n(2) A child or adolescent who is expressing a “position” regarding a\ncontested issue in the legal conflict may have external influences on\ntheir perceptions, or that negatively impact their coping skills.\n(f) While it is common in traditional treatment for one parent to be more involved\nin child treatment than the other, this therapy structure creates a risk in court-\ninvolved treatment. A CIT should consider both parent-child relationships\nand each parent’s perspective in court-involved treatment.\n6\nGUIDELINE 2: PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES\n2.1 A CIT should establish and maintain appropriate role boundaries\n(a) A CIT should inform potential clients, and others who may be relying on the\ntherapist’s opinion or services, of the nature of the services that can be offered\nby the therapist and the limits thereof. This includes providing thorough\ninformed consent to clients/parents and appropriate information to others who\nmay rely on the therapist’s information. (See Guideline 6 and Guideline 10.)\n(b) A CIT should resist pressure from anyone to provide services beyond or\nantithetical to the therapeutic role, as defined by recognized professional and\nethical standards or guidelines.\n(c) A CIT should explain to clients any decisions to decline to provide certain\nservices. If others (e.g., the Court guardian ad litem, minor’s counsel or\nagency) have requested services that the CIT considers inappropriate, the CIT\nshould also explain decisions to decline these requests, to the degree that\ninformation provided is not privileged or privilege has been waived.\n(d) A CIT should be prepared to modify elements of the therapeutic process, if\nappropriate, and to explain the necessity for the modification.\n(e) A CIT should apprise the Court of any conflicts between the Court’s\nexpectations and the ethical and professional obligations, or role limitations,\nof the therapist.\n2.2 A CIT should demonstrate respect for parties, families, the legal process and\nits participants\n(a) A CIT should communicate respect for the legal system to clients, collaterals,\nand others who may rely on the therapist’s work, information or opinions.\n(b) A CIT should provide a thorough informed consent processes to parents, and\nage-appropriate explanations to children, as described in Guideline 6.\n(c) A CIT should communicate, within the limits of any applicable privilege,\nregarding the limits and responsibilities of the therapist’s role.\n(d) A CIT should respect each parent’s rights, as defined by relevant orders or\nlaw, regarding knowledge of, consenting to, and/or participating in a child’s\ntreatment.\n(e) A CIT should be knowledgeable about appropriate expectations for\ndevelopmentally acceptable behavior in children while respecting their\nindependent feelings, perceptions, and developmental needs.\n7\n(f) A CIT should communicate with counsel in a balanced manner when in a\nneutral role and authorized to do so.\n2.3 A CIT should provide clear, non-technical communication of observations\nand opinions to adult clients, parents of child clients, and other professionals\nwhen appropriate and permitted by applicable privilege\n2.4 A CIT should maintain professional objectivity\n(a) A CIT should actively seek information that will provide the most thorough\nunderstanding of his/her client’s circumstances and issues, while remaining\nwithin the limits of the therapist’s assigned therapeutic role in the case.\n(b) When children are involved in treatment, a CIT has an enhanced obligation to\nconsider multiple hypotheses, seek information and involvement from both\nparents and avoid the biasing effects of one-sided or limited information.\n(c) A CIT should make efforts to consider and assess treatment issues from the\nperspective of each involved individual. This does not preclude maintaining a\nstrong therapeutic alliance with a parent client/patient in individual therapy,\nbut may require exploring with the client how others may perceive the issues.\n(d) To the degree possible in the given therapeutic role, the CIT should remain\naware of the information emerging in the legal process in order to assist the\nclient in coping with it.\n2.5 The CIT should manage relationships responsibly\n(a) A CIT should recognize that the therapeutic relationship may change as a\nfamily’s involvement with the Court changes or as the therapist communicates\nto other professionals, collaterals or the Court.\n(b) If a parent or family who has not previously been court-involved becomes\ninvolved in a legal process and asks the therapist to continue services, the CIT\nshould discuss with the relevant individuals and/or family members the\npotential effect of Court involvement on the therapy. This should include\ndiscussion of potential requests for release of therapeutic information to others\nincluding a child custody evaluator, parenting coordinator, other\nprofessionals, or the Court.\n(c) If a CIT who has not previously been involved with a client’s ongoing\nlitigation is asked to provide information or have other involvement in the\nlegal process, the CIT should notify the client and/or the client’s legal\nrepresentative of such requests. If the CIT believes the release of information\n8\nwill adversely impact the client, the CIT should seek legal advice and notify\nthe Court.\n(d) The CIT should clearly document informed consent on the above issues.\n2.6 A CIT should maintain accountability\n(a) The therapist in a child-centered role should recognize that active intervention\nmay result in the dissatisfaction of one or both parents, but should\nnevertheless maintain focus on the welfare of the child client.\n(b) If disputes arise regarding interpretation of Court orders governing treatment,\nthe CIT should seek direction or clarification from the Court, or an authorized\nCourt representative in the case.\n(c) The CIT should recognize that others in the legal system (e.g., custody\nevaluator, parenting coordinator, child’s counsel or the Court) may have a role\nin monitoring or reviewing the therapeutic process.\n(d) The CIT should recognize that his/her judgments, interventions, reports,\ntestimony and opinions may have a profound impact on outcomes for children\nand families. The CIT should remain objective at all times, should use caution\nin forming and expressing opinions, and should use particular caution in\ndrawing conclusions from limited observations or sources of information.\n(e) A CIT should recognize that the dynamics of a court-involved case may create\nconflicts or disagreements with litigating parents or lead to demands that the\ntherapist withdraw from the case. The CIT should recognize that therapeutic\nconfrontation of a parent or a child, or a refusal to accede to the wishes of a\nparent or child, may frustrate that individual’s desires, but does not necessarily\nconstitute a conflict of interest. Such therapeutic confrontation may be\ntherapeutically appropriate or even essential. In such a situation, withdrawing\nfrom the case or abandoning the intervention, unless terminated by the client,\nmay be antithetical to the interest of the child or family.\nGUIDELINE 3: COMPETENCE\n3.1 A CIT has a responsibility to develop and maintain specialized competence\nsufficient for the roles they undertake\n3.2 Gaining and maintaining competence\n(a) A CIT has a responsibility to obtain education and training, and to maintain\ncurrent knowledge, in areas including, but not limited to:\n(1) Characteristics of divorcing/separated families and children\n9\n(2) Family systems and other systems in which court-involved families\ninteract\n(3) The impact of high interparental conflict on post-separation custody\narrangements\n(4) Effective interventions with divorcing or separated families\n(5) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)Adaptations of traditional therapeutic approaches that may be\nNecessary to work with divorcing or separated families\n(6) characteristics and needs of special populations who may be\nInvolved in treatment\n(7) Ethical issues and applicable local legal standards\n(b) A CIT should utilize continuing education and professional development\nresources to maintain current knowledge of issues relevant to court-involved\ntreatment.\n(c) A CIT may also gain some of the required knowledge through experience and\nconsultation with colleagues; however, clinical experience should not be a\nsubstitute for knowledge of the underlying science, relevant research, legal\nissues and standards of practice.\n3.3 Areas of competence\n(a) The CIT should maintain knowledge and familiarity with current research\nrelated to psychological issues in areas including, but not limited to:\n(1) Child development and coping, including developmental tasks\n(2) Child interviewing and suggestibility\n(3) Children’s decision-making ability, including appropriate means of\nunderstanding children’s abilities and interpreting expressed\npreferences or opinions\n(4) Factors in divorcing families that increase risk to children, or\npromote resilience in children\n(5) Domestic violence\n(6) Child abuse and child welfare\n(7) High conflict dynamics, including risks to children from exposure\nto parental conflict, parental undermining, alienation and\nestrangement\n(8) Treatment approaches, including both traditional methods and\nadaptations for divorcing or separated families\n(9) Parenting and behavioral interventions\n(10) Special needs issues, including medical issues, psychiatric\ndiagnoses, substance abuse, learning or educational problems,\ndevelopmental delays, etc.\n(11) Ethnic, cultural, and sexual orientation differences among families\n10\n(b) The CIT should maintain knowledge and familiarity with legal information\nand issues related to court-involved therapy, including, but not limited to:\n(1) Statutes and local Court rules in the therapist’s jurisdiction\n(2) Case precedents relevant to court-involved treatment\n(3) Interactions and potential conflicts between governing mental\nhealth practice and family Court expectations or family law statues\n(4) Ethical and professional guidelines and standards applicable to the\nrole of the CIT, obtaining ethics consultation as appropriate\n(5) Circumstances under which it may be necessary or appropriate for\nthe therapist to consult an attorney\n(c) The CIT should seek appropriate consultations when issues arise that are\noutside of the CIT’s expertise.\n3.4 Understanding of professional roles and resources\n(a) The CIT should be familiar with the roles of other professionals with whom\nthe CIT may interface while providing therapy in a case.\n(b) The CIT should understand the roles of the child custody evaluator and the\nparenting coordinator, and the impact that the appointment of such\nprofessionals may have on both the process of therapy and the privacy of\ntherapeutic information.\n(c) The CIT should understand the roles of the minor’s counsel or guardian ad\nlitem, and should be aware of the laws governing confidentiality of treatment\ninformation when one of these professionals is appointed.\n3.5 Representation of competence, state of professional knowledge\n(a) The CIT should accurately represent his/her areas of competence, advise\nclients/parents if an issue arises that is beyond the CIT’s knowledge and\nexpertise, and initiate consultation and/or referral, when appropriate.\n(b) The CIT should understand the limits of scientific knowledge and use caution\nto avoid overstating the certainty or parameters of professional opinions. (See\nGuideline 10.)\n3.6 Consideration of impact of personal beliefs and experiences\n(a) The CIT should remain familiar with current research on the impact of\npersonal bias, personal beliefs and cultural and value differences, factors that\nmay contribute to bias, and efforts that may be undertaken to contain or\nmanage potentially biasing conditions in the CIT’s work.\n11\n(b) The CIT should recognize and acknowledge that powerful issues may arise in\ncourt-related cases that generate personal reactions in the therapist or others,\nand take steps to counterbalance exposure to information or otherwise manage\nthese issues.\n(c) The CIT should obtain appropriate consultation to assist in maintaining\nprofessional objectivity.\nGUIDELINE 4: MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS\n4.1 The CIT should avoid serving simultaneously in multiple roles, particularly\nif these create a conflict of interest. For example, the CIT should not serve\nsimultaneously as therapist and evaluator or as therapist and friend.\nSimilarly, the CIT is strongly discouraged from performing different roles\nsequentially, as, for example, a therapist who becomes an evaluator or a therapist\nwho becomes a parenting coordinator.\n4.2 The CIT should disclose to all relevant parties any multiple relationships that\ncannot be avoided and the potential negative impact of such multiple roles.\n(a) The CIT who discovers that he/she is performing multiple roles in a case\nshould promptly seek to resolve any conflicts in a manner that is least harmful\nto the client and family. The CIT should clarify the expectations of each role\nand seek to avoid or minimize the negative impact of assuming multiple roles.\n(b) The CIT should recognize that relationships with clients are not time limited\nand that prior relationships, or the anticipation of future relationships, may\nhave an adverse effect on the CIT’s ability to be objective.\n(c) The CIT should attempt to avoid conflicts of interest and should address them\nas soon as they arise, or the potential for conflict becomes known, by:\n(1) Identifying a real or apparent conflict of interest as soon as it\nbecomes known to the CIT\n(2) Refusing to assume a therapeutic role if personal, professional, legal,\nfinancial or other interests or relationships could reasonably be\nexpected to impair objectivity, competence or effectiveness in the\nprovision of services\n(3) Communicating with the client or potential client or counsel, and, if\nnecessary, with the Court, about the existence of the conflict.\n(4) Recognizing that the appearance of a conflict of interest, as well as\nan actual conflict of interest, can diminish public trust and\nconfidence both in the therapeutic service and in the Court\n(5) Differentiating between conflicts that require declining to assume or\n12\nwithdrawing from the therapeutic role, as opposed to multiple or\nsequential roles that may be undertaken with waivers from the client\nor parent\n(6) Recognizing the risks of undertaking conflicting roles, even if the\nclient or parent signs a waiver\n(7) Clearly documenting the disclosure of any waived conflict, the\nclient’s ability to understand it, and the client’s waiver. The client\nmust receive a clear explanation of the conflict, and it may also be\nnecessary to provide such explanations to other professionals or\nagencies relying on the therapist’s work or information\nGUIDELINE 5: FEE ARRANGEMENTS\n5.1 The CIT should establish a clear written fee agreement with the responsible\nparties prior to commencing the treatment relationship\n(a) A CIT may send a written fee agreement to the parties and/or client(s) prior to\ncommencing treatment.\n(b) If the case is not court-involved, a CIT may discuss the terms and fee\nrequirements of treatment directly with the parties and/or client. This\ndiscussion should be documented in the CIT’s record.\n(c) If the case is already court-involved, or likely to be, a CIT may send the fee\nand consent agreements to counsel.\n5.2 The CIT should provide written documentation to each responsible party\n(a) Documentation should include a description of the treatment services to be\nprovided, including all of the elements of informed consent described in\nGuideline 6.\n(b) A CIT should provide a fee agreement that contains, at a minimum:\n(1) A description of all services and charges\n(2) Expectations regarding payment, including, if applicable:\n(i) fees associated with missed or cancelled sessions,\n(ii) costs/fees generated by one parent,\n(iii) consequences of non-payment, including its potential impact\non continued provision of services,\n(iv) the use of collection agencies or other legal measures that may\nbe taken to collect the fee (see attached sample agreement).\n(3) Policies with regard to insurance reimbursement, if any. This should\ninclude issues such as identifying the person responsible for\nsubmitting the insurance form, payment for covered and non-covered\n13\nservices, responsibility for submitting treatment plans (if required by\nthe insurer) and the consequences of using insurance.\n(4) Policies regarding advance payments, if any, for treatment services\nand the use of those payments\n(5) A procedure for handling of disputes regarding payment\n(c) If the therapy is court-ordered, the CIT should provide to the Court all\ninformation required to engage the CIT so that the Court can issue an\nappropriate and comprehensive order. The written fee agreement may be\nincorporated into the Court order that initiates the therapy. The therapist\nshould request that the Court specify the party responsible for the payment or\nthe specific apportionment between the parents or parties. In the event that the\nCourt order fails to address the issue of fees adequately, the therapist should\ntake appropriate steps to obtain clarification from the Court before providing\nservices. Arrangements should be sufficiently clear to prevent or resolve most\nfee-related disputes, and for a future judicial officer or reviewer to be able to\nresolve any such disputes submitted to the Court.\n(d) If treatment is terminated or suspended due to non-payment, the CIT should\nconduct the termination or suspension in accordance with the order, fee\nagreement and ethical principles.\n(e) The CIT should maintain complete and accurate written records of all\namounts billed and all amounts paid.\nGUIDELINE 6: INFORMED CONSENT\n6.1 At the outset of therapy, the CIT should provide a thorough informed\nconsent process to adult clients and parents or legal guardians if the therapy\ninvolves the child\n(a) A CIT has a professional obligation to inform the client of the limits of\nconfidentiality and privilege at the outset of the therapeutic relationship, to\npromote informed decision-making throughout treatment and to document\nsuch explanations in the CIT’s record. The CIT should clarify that these\ncautions do not constitute legal advice, and that the CIT will obey the Court’s\norders regarding treatment information.\n(b) The informed consent should use language that is understandable and\nincludes, at a minimum, information about the nature and anticipated course\nof the therapy, risks and benefits of the therapy, fees, the potential\ninvolvement of other individuals in the therapy, and a discussion of\nconfidentiality.\n14\n(c) The CIT should be aware of state laws that impact confidentiality and access\nto records and these should be incorporated in the informed consent.\n(d) Clients or their counsel should have an opportunity to ask questions, obtain\nanswers, and discuss their concerns. These discussions should be\ndocumented in the CIT’s record.\n6.2 If a child is to be involved in treatment, there are special considerations\n(a) A CIT should generally avoid accepting a child into treatment without\nnotifying or consulting with both parents.\n(b) A CIT should request copies of Court orders or custody judgments\ndocumenting each parent’s right/authority to make decisions regarding\ntreatment and delineation of each parent’s access to treatment information.\n(c) In rare and urgent cases, such as when there is strong reason to suspect a risk\nto a child’s safety, a CIT may accept a child in treatment at the request of one\nparent. This should only occur if that parent has clear legal authority to\nconsent and pending efforts to either notify the other parent or obtain\npermission from the Court; however, the CIT should be aware that such a\ndecision may increase risk to the child, and to the CIT.\n(d) A CIT should explain the nature and purpose of the treatment to a child in\nage-appropriate language. It may be necessary to revisit these issues as\ntreatment proceeds.\n(e) A CIT should discuss the limits of parental involvement and confidentiality\nwith the parents or guardians of a child or adolescent involved in treatment.\n6.3 When a CIT becomes involved in treatment at the request of a third party\nsuch as the Court, an attorney, or a social service agency, the CIT should be\nespecially attentive to informed consent issues\n(a) The CIT should identify to the client the name of the person or agency that\nrequested the services and the potential impact this may have on the treatment.\n(b) If an adult client or parent does not sign the informed consent, or otherwise\nhas significant disagreements with the treatment process, the CIT should defer\ncommencement of services and refer the client back to the third party agency\nor the Court for clarification.\n(c) If the CIT has been appointed by the Court to provide treatment to one or\nmore adults and an adult refuses to sign consent documents, the CIT should\ndefer commencement of services until consent is obtained or the Court takes\naction to resolve the issue.\n15\n(d) If a CIT is asked by anyone to provide treatment to a child and one parent\nsupports treatment while the other refuses consent, the therapist should refer\nthe parties back to the Court for resolution of the dispute between the parents,\nand then proceed as the Court directs.\n(e) If the court-ordered treatment is to proceed, it is recommended that the CIT\nrequire a treatment order, specifying the nature of the services to be provided\nand the parameters of treatment, before proceeding with treatment.\n6.4 When more than one individual participates in the therapy, the CIT should\nclarify with each person the nature of the relationship between the\nparticipants and between each participant and the therapist. The CIT\nshould also clarify his/her roles and responsibilities, the anticipated use of\ninformation provided by each person, and the extent and limits of\nconfidentiality and privilege\n6.5 On a case-specific basis, the CIT should explain to the client the manner in\nwhich treatment information will be handled. Issues to be clarified may\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n(a) Whether the consent of one or both parents will be required to release\ninformation from conjoint, co-parenting or marital therapy\n(b) Whether information will be released to a custody evaluator, parenting\ncoordinator, the Court, or any other individual, and the extent of the\ninformation to be released\n(c) Whether, and how, the CIT will communicate to the Court in the event that\none or both parents do not cooperate with court-ordered treatment\n(d) What will happen if the CIT is subpoenaed to give testimony in a court-related\nmatter\n(e) What information can be released to insurance companies, the Court, the other\nparent, or other entities to enable the CIT to collect his/her fees.\n6.6 The parent/client should be encouraged to consult with counsel before\nsigning a therapy/informed consent agreement, if the parent or client is\nrepresented\n6.7 If the CIT’s level of Court involvement changes or requests are made to\nchange the CIT’s role, the CIT should inform the client of the risks, benefits\nand impact of any potential changes in treatment\n16\n(a) The CIT should obtain consultation before contemplating a change in his/her\nrole that might create a conflict of interest or alter therapeutic alliances.\n(b) If the CIT becomes aware of potentially conflicting roles, he/she should take\nreasonable steps to immediately disclose, clarify and discuss the potential\nconflicts and any potential adverse impact. The CIT should make best efforts\nto minimize any negative impact, including withdrawing from the case, if\nappropriate.\n(c) If the parties consent to a change in the CIT’s role, the CIT should document\nthe revised informed consent process.\n6.8 The CIT should be sensitive to the possibility of being asked to provide\nfeedback to third parties or to testify as a witness. The CIT should inform the\nclient of this potential at the beginning of the informed consent process and as\nnecessary thereafter.\n(a) The CIT should take reasonable steps to clarify the limits of the therapeutic\nrole, the potential scope of information to be released, and the potential\nimplications of the release of information or the testimony for the client (see\nGuideline 7). In no case should the CIT attempt to provide legal advice to the\nclient.\nGUIDELINE 7: PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVILEGE\n7.1 The CIT should understand the principal issues that arise in court-related\ntherapy in regard to client/patient confidentiality and privilege.\n(a) The CIT should be aware that laws and standards vary markedly among\njurisdictions, and there may be conflicts in the law within a single jurisdiction.\nIssues that may vary among (and within) jurisdictions include, but are not\nlimited to:\n(1) The identified client\n(2) Assertion and waiver of the client’s privilege\n(3) Under what circumstances the mental health professional can or\nmust disclose confidential information\n(b) The CIT should be aware that ethical, clinical, and legal issues related to\nconfidentiality/privilege may differ depending on whether a parent, child,\ncouple or family is in treatment.\n(c) The CIT should be aware of clinical issues related to disclosure of confidential\ninformation. (See Guideline 8.7.)\n17\n7.2 The impact of litigation on decisions regarding use of treatment information.\n(a) The CIT should also be aware that a client or parent’s legal case may be\naffected by the client’s decision to release or decline to release treatment\ninformation. The CIT should encourage the client/parent to seek appropriate\nlegal consultation before making this decision.\n(b) The CIT should consider the impact of the Court context on a client’s\ndecisions about the use of treatment information and should take precautions\naccordingly.\n(c) The CIT should consider that situational pressures may affect the client or\nparent’s judgment or authority on the issue of waiving the privilege regarding\ntreatment information. These pressures may include requests from the Court\nor other professionals with influence on the legal proceedings (e.g., a custody\nevaluator or parenting coordinator) that the parent waive his/her own, or the\nchild’s privilege as to the treatment relationship.\n(d) The CIT should be aware that in some jurisdictions or situations, parents may\nnot hold the right to waive or assert the child’s privilege in court-involved\ntreatment or treatment of the child. In some jurisdictions, a CIT has the option\nor duty to resist disclosure of information, or seek direction from the Court, if\nthe CIT determines that disclosure of the information risks the welfare of the\nchild. The CIT should be familiar with the appropriate procedures for his/her\njurisdiction.\n7.3 A CIT should recognize the limits of his/her expertise and, when in doubt as to\nwhether information requested about treatment can be released, seek legal\nadvice or request direction from the Court\n7.4 Ongoing obligation to inform clients\n(a) A CIT should revisit the discussion of confidentiality with the client as\ncircumstances change, or as issues arise in therapy that may result in the\ndisclosure of treatment information.\n(b) If therapy is court-ordered and there is dispute regarding privacy,\nconfidentiality and privilege, the CIT should seek clarification from the Court\nprior to commencing services. If a dispute arises as to the interpretation of the\nCourt order after services have begun, the CIT should seek direction from the\nCourt before releasing information.\n18\n7.5 Special issues in children’s treatment\n(a) A CIT should be familiar with general provisions governing confidentiality of\nchildren’s treatment information in his/her jurisdiction, including:\n(1) Who holds the child’s privilege and how a child’s privilege can be\nwaived or asserted\n(2) Under what circumstances a child or adolescent may have a role in\nthis decision\n(3) How the CIT should respond if he/she receives conflicting\ninstructions from the parents\n(4) How the CIT should respond if he/she believes that disclosure of\ntreatment information poses a substantial risk of harm to the child\n(b) At the outset of a child’s treatment, the CIT should clarify the provisions of\nthe order or therapy agreement regarding the child’s treatment information.\nThese issues include, but are not limited to:\n(1) How information about a child’s progress will be shared with\nparents\n(2) Whether the consent of one or both parents will be required to\nrelease information about the child’s progress\n(3) The role that the child’s thoughts and feelings will play in\ndetermining what information is shared, and how it is shared\n(4) Circumstances in which the CIT may be required to release\ninformation to the parent or other professionals\n(5) Circumstances that might require further discussion, clarification or\nmodification of the order or agreement as the treatment progresses\n(c) A CIT should prepare the child client for the release of treatment information,\naddress the child’s feelings about the issue, and assist the child in coping with\nany stressors that may result.\n(d) The CIT should adapt explanations to the developmental and situational needs\nof each child.\n(1) When working with a child client, the CIT should clarify the limits\nof confidentiality in developmentally appropriate language\n(2) A CIT should not make blanket promises to a child that treatment\ninformation will be confidential\n7.6 Considerations for therapists covered under the Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act (HIPAA)\nIf the CIT is a HIPAA-covered entity, he/she must be aware of his/her obligations\nunder the Act, and the how those obligations may change if the client or family\n19\nbecomes involved with the Court. When requirements under HIPAA appear to be\nin conflict with other laws or Court orders, the CIT should obtain legal\nconsultation.\n7.7 Responding to requests for treatment information from third parties\n(a) The CIT should request a copy of the release signed by the client, former\nclient, parent, or other authorized person. The CIT should not communicate\nwith a third party without an appropriate release or order of the Court\nauthorizing disclosure.\n(b) Prior to providing client information to a third party, the CIT should attempt\nto inform the client or former client about the request for release of\ninformation.\n(c) The CIT should inform the client or former client of the nature of the\ninformation that may be released to a third party if the client waives the\nprivilege. If appropriate, the CIT should also refer the client or former client\nto his/her attorney to assist the client in making this decision.\n(d) A release does not supersede a Court order; therefore, prior to releasing\ninformation to a third party, a CIT should consult any agreement or Court\norder that governs the treatment.\n7.8 Responding to a subpoena\n(a) A CIT should be aware of differences between subpoenas and Court orders.\n(b) A CIT who has received a subpoena should consider consulting an attorney\nfamiliar with both legal issues in the jurisdiction related to mental health law\nand the requirements of the Court in which the family is involved.\nProcedures, requirements, and the CIT’s options will vary depending on the\njurisdiction, whether the case is being heard in a family Court or juvenile\ndependency Court, and many other issues.\n(c) A CIT should not automatically respond to a subpoena by disclosing written\nor oral information.\n(d) A CIT should not ignore a subpoena.\n(e) The CIT may wish to consider the additional guidance provided in Appendix\nA regarding specific steps that may be helpful in responding to a subpoena.\n7.9 Responding to a Court order for release of treatment information\n(a) If the CIT is ordered by the Court to release information, particularly over the\n20\nobjection of one of the parties, the CIT should request a written order\nspecifying the parameters of information to be released.\n(b) If there are outstanding legal questions regarding what information can be\nreleased (such as whether the CIT can release information from other agencies\nor child protective services), the CIT may wish to obtain the assistance of an\nattorney who can bring these issues to attention of the Court and obtain\nclarification or direction.\n7.10 Appealing a Court order\nThere are some circumstances in which a CIT may believe that disclosing\ninformation may violate ethical or professional practice guidelines applicable\nto mental health practice. In such a case, the CIT may wish to consult an\nattorney familiar with the laws of mental health privilege/confidentiality in that\njurisdiction.\nGUIDELINE 8: METHODS AND PROCEDURES\n8.1 The CIT should adhere to the methods and procedures generally accepted in\nhis/her particular discipline. In addition, the CIT should maintain methods and\nprocedures consistent with being involved in situations, which may include\nlitigation, testimony, and the reporting of various matters to Court, parties, or their\nattorneys.\n8.2 Obtaining necessary information if the therapy is court-ordered\n(a) The CIT should attempt to obtain all information necessary to conduct the\ncourt-ordered therapy and should discuss the goals of the court-ordered\ntherapy with the client.\n(b) As appropriate to the specific case, the CIT should request information that\nmay be necessary for effective treatment. This may include permission to\nspeak to a prior therapist or other involved professionals, copies of prior Court\norders, therapy records, and reports from child custody evaluators, child\nprotective services, or a guardian ad litem.\n(c) The CIT should obtain necessary information, including copies of relevant\nCourt orders, to confirm that his/her role is clearly defined and consistent with\nthe therapeutic role and the CIT’s expertise.\n21\n(d) If the CIT is unable to obtain information from the parties or counsel that is\nnecessary to conduct treatment, the CIT may apply to the Court for further\ndirection if the CIT has obtained appropriate releases. Application to the Court\nshould be preceded by proper notice to the parties and counsel.\n8.3 Therapeutic role and process\n(a) The CIT has a responsibility to identify both the intended clients and any\nothers intended to be the beneficiaries of the intervention.\n(b) When the intended beneficiary of the intervention is an individual client, the\nprimary focus of the therapist is the client’s welfare and treatment is\nimplemented for the benefit of the client. Therapists with different treatment\norientations may identify different treatment goals, but all focus on improving\nclient’s functioning.\n(c) In other cases, a relationship or family unit may be the identified client or may\nbe the participants in counseling, but the goal may be to reduce conflict or\npromote behavior change for the benefit of the child (e.g., co-parenting or\nconjoint/reunification therapy).\n(d) The CIT should clearly identify the goals, procedures and beneficiaries based\non any relevant orders and in collaboration with the client(s) and other\nprofessionals as appropriate, and should clearly communicate this information\nto participants in the therapy.\n8.4 The CIT should understand that the information provided by the client\nduring the course of the treatment is based upon the client’s experience and\nperspective, which may sometimes be distorted or lacking balance and\ncomprehensiveness\n(a) The CIT should strive to maintain professional objectivity, and to remain\naware of the impact of the therapeutic alliance on the therapist’s information\nand perspective.\n(b) The CIT should actively consider alternative hypotheses regarding the\ninformation (i.e., data) he/she is receiving in the treatment.\n(c) The CIT should strive to be aware of societal and personal biases and\ncontinuously monitor his/her actions for evidence of potential bias. Awareness\nof research and focus on the treatment data inform the CIT and help limit the\npotential for bias. The CIT should consider withdrawing from a case when\nhe/she is unable to manage a known bias and/or is unable to maintain\nobjectivity.\n22\n(d) The CIT should be aware that the treatment may be influenced by the client or\nfamily’s involvement in legal processes, and that the legal process may be\ninfluenced by the actions of the therapist.\n(e) The CIT must constantly guard against/protect his or her work from threats to\nprofessional objectivity and role boundaries.\n8.5 Selecting appropriate treatment methods\n(a) A CIT should not exceed the bounds of his/her professional competence in\nhis/her diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment of clients.\n(b) A CIT should use methods or interventions that are generally accepted within\nthe professional communities and literature, and should apply methods or\ninterventions appropriate to the situations and characteristics of court-involved\nfamilies.\n(c) A CIT should be able to justify and explain the choice of methods based upon\nthe current state of professional knowledge and research.\n(d) The CIT should select treatment methods or approaches that minimize the\npotential for biased or inappropriate interpretations of client’s statements and\nbehaviors or perceptions of others’ behavior. This may include deliberate\nbalance in asking questions, challenging assumptions, and supplementing\nbehavioral observations with other methods of inquiry.\n(e) A CIT should exercise caution in forming opinions or structuring therapy\nbased on limited or one-sided information.\n(f) A CIT should maintain current knowledge about the validity (or lack of\nvalidity) of using specific behaviors as a basis for diagnosis or treatment, and\nshould employ treatment methods that allow the therapist to gather\ninformation from a variety of methods and observations.\n8.6 Critical examination of information\n(a) A CIT should critically examine information received from a client before\nformulating or offering a clinical opinion. This is especially important in light\nof the possibility that a therapeutic alliance may produce a bias toward the\nclient.\n(b) A CIT should recognize that loss of therapeutic objectivity may harm a child\nor family, whether or not the therapist reports or testifies about the therapy.\nTherapists should avoid inappropriate bias by actively considering, and\nexploring, rival hypotheses about a client’s difficulties.\n23\n8.7 A CIT should consider the clinical implications of actions taken when the\nCIT is asked to release treatment information, and should endeavor to\nminimize risks in these areas\n(a) The therapist should be aware that an adult client requesting the release of\ninformation may not fully attend to, or understand, the risks and benefits of\nsuch a decision. This may lead to distress in the client or damage to the\ntherapeutic alliance, if the client is surprised by the therapist’s information or\nopinion.\n(b) The therapist should assist the client in understanding:\n(1) The risks and benefits of releasing information\n(2) The nature of the information in the client’s records\n(3) The CIT’s obligation to provide complete answers when questioned\nunder oath and to avoid misleading other professionals or the Court\n(4) Other potential factors that may lead to distress in the client or\ndamage to the therapeutic relationship due to the release of\ninformation\n(c) When a child is involved in treatment and the CIT is asked to release\ntreatment information, the CIT should consider and address issues to\nminimize disruption of treatment and avoid distress in the child. Issues to\nconsider may include:\n(1) Appreciation of the parent’s right to information and any concerns\nthat he or she may have about the child or the therapy\n(2) Protection of the child’s treatment progress and privacy\n(3) Potential for disruption of the therapeutic relationship if the parent\nfeels excluded or resorts to litigation in order to obtain information\n(4) Possibilities for negotiating the parent’s involvement and managing\nthe sharing of information without violation of the child’s privacy,\nwholesale release of treatment information, or litigation\n(d) The CIT should consider and address the various clinical possibilities in\nchildren’s expressed preferences about disclosure of information. The CIT\nshould consider the potential implications of whatever action the CIT takes,\nand should utilize available therapeutic options for dealing with the child’s\ninformation. Issues to consider and address may include:\n(1) Treatment goals related to the children’s resolving of issues with\nparents\n(2) A child’s realistic or unrealistic fears about the parent’s response to\nthe information\n(3) The child’s own emotional issues or difficulty in expressing feelings\ndirectly\n24\n(4) Whether the child will ultimately be empowered or protected by\nhaving the CIT share information on the child’s behalf\n(5) Whether the child needs protective measures to prevent harm\nresulting from the sharing of therapeutic information\n(6) Whether information can be disclosed in a therapeutic rather than\nlegal setting\n(e) The CIT should prepare both adult and child clients for the sharing of\ninformation and endeavor to anticipate any problems the client may\nexperience as a result.\n8.8 A CIT should seek appropriate advice\nWhen in doubt about an appropriate course of action, the CIT should consider\nseeking legal advice or professional consultation. Such advice may protect both\nthe clients/participants in therapy and the CIT.\nGUIDELINE 9: DOCUMENTATION\n9.1 A CIT should create documentation so that the Court can understand the\ntreatment process, progress and financial arrangements\n9.2 A CIT should establish and maintain a system of record keeping that is\nconsistent with applicable law, rules, and regulations and that safeguards\napplicable privacy, confidentiality, and legal privilege. A CIT should create\nand maintain records reasonably contemporaneously with the provision of\nservices.\n(a) In deciding what to include in the record, the CIT may determine what is\nnecessary in order to:\n(1) Provide competent care\n(2) Assist collaborating professionals in delivery of care\n(3) Provide documentation required for reimbursement or required\nadministratively under contracts or laws\n(4) Effectively document any decision making, especially in high-risk\nsituations\n(5) Allow the CIT to effectively answer a legal or regulatory complaint\n(b) If a client, parent or third party requests limited record keeping as a condition\nof treatment the CIT should explain that record keeping must meet\nprofessional standards.\n25\n9.3 Records should be organized and sufficiently detailed\nA CIT should maintain records that facilitate the provision of future services by\nthe CIT and by other professionals, ensure accuracy of billing and payments, and\nensure compliance with ethical requirements and laws. Records should be\nsufficiently detailed, legible and readily available for reproduction upon receipt of\nappropriate releases or Court orders.\n9.4 Confidentiality and security of records\nA CIT should make all reasonable efforts to maintain confidentiality in creating, storing,\naccessing, transferring and disposing of records under his/her control. A CIT should\nmaintain active control of records, provide appropriate training to any support staff,\nand take reasonable care to prevent the loss or destruction of records.\n9.5 Ethical and statutory requirements\n(a) A CIT should be cognizant of and follow relevant ethical and statutory\nrequirements regarding maintaining records.\n9.6 Communicate and clarify recordkeeping with the client and/or parents\n(a) When the client is a child, the CIT should request any orders establishing who\nhas the authority to consent to release of records. A minor may have the legal\nprerogative to consent to treatment, but the parent may nevertheless seek\naccess to the records. A CIT should verify parents’ statements of having the\nsole authority to consent to or block release of records by requesting relevant\ndocuments.\n(b) When the CIT has multiple clients, such as when a parent participates in\ntherapy with the child, the CIT should clarify as part of the informed consent\nprocedure how the records are kept and who can authorize their release.\n(c) A CIT should clarify any costs associated with providing copies of records\nand follow relevant statutes regarding fee arrangements. A CIT should not\nrefuse to release records needed for emergency treatment because a client has\nnot paid for services.\n(d) Even when clients are participating in therapy pursuant to a Court order, the\nCIT should clarify policies, procedures and fees associated with the release of\nrecords and confidentiality.\n26\nGUIDELINE 10: PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION\nCommunication from a CIT to another therapist, the client, parents, counsel, or the Court\ncarries with it an obligation to ensure that the communication is authorized, clear, and\naccurate. A CIT should recognize the adversarial nature of the legal system and the\npotential impact of the therapist’s observations and opinions.\n10.1 Authorization to communicate\nA CIT should take reasonable steps to ensure that he/she is authorized to\ncommunicate with a third party, as described in Guideline 7.\n10.2 Accuracy in communication\n(a) In communication with others, a CIT should take reasonable steps to ensure\nthat he/she is accurate in communicating:\n(1) The nature of the service provided\n(2) His or her opinions on diagnosis, prognosis, and/or progress in\ntreatment\n(3) His or her opinions on appropriate actions that would support the\ntherapy\n(4) His or her understanding of the role the therapist has with the family\nand in the Court process\n(5) Reports or observations of parents’ or children’s behavior\n(b) The CIT should make reasonable efforts to ensure that information regarding\nhis or her services, including treatment, reports and testimony is\ncommunicated in language that can be understood by consumers and\nminimizes potential for misuse of the therapist’s information.\n10.3 Communicating limits and distinctions\nA CIT should communicate the bases and limitations of observations and\nopinions.\n(a) In all communications, especially in reports or testimony, the CIT should\ndistinguish between observations, verbatim statements, inferences derived\nfrom his or her sources of information and conclusions or assessments\nreached.\n(b) A CIT should articulate the limits of any communications. A CIT should\ndecline to communicate opinions, recommendations, or information\nrequested:\n27\n(1) When there is insufficient data on which to form a reliable opinion\n(2) When there is no authorization to do so\n(3) When the opinion requested is inconsistent with the role of the CIT\n(c) Where the information available to the CIT might support more than one\ntherapeutic assessment or opinion, the CIT should present and acknowledge\nthe alternate possibilities and any treatment data or research supporting them.\n(d) When necessary and appropriate, a CIT should be prepared to explain the\nlimits of the CIT’s role and the reasons it is inappropriate to give testimony or\nopinions in violation of that role.\n10.4 Appropriate parties to include in communication\nA CIT should carefully consider who should be aware of and involved in each\nprofessional communication.\n(a) The CIT should consider whether one or both counsel, a guardian ad litem,\nchild’s counsel, other CITs, or parenting coordinator should be included in the\ncommunication.\n(b) The CIT should respond with caution if an adult client’s attorney requests a\ntreatment report, particularly if the request comes through the client. The CIT\nshould discuss with the client the potential content and implications of such a\nreport, as discussed in Guidelines 7 and 8. With an appropriate release, the\nCIT may also wish to consider consulting with the adult client’s attorney to\nensure that the attorney is aware of the potential content and implications of a\nreport from the therapist.\n(c) The CIT in a neutral role, such as that of child’s therapist, co-parenting\ntherapist or conjoint/reunification therapist, should avoid unilateral\ncommunication with either parent’s attorney in order to avoid appearance of\nbias and to contain the potential for actual bias.\n10.5 Testimony\n(a) A CIT should recognize the limits of his/her knowledge, and the potential\nimpact that testifying in Court may have on the client and on treatment. Prior\nto testifying, a CIT should thoroughly discuss these issues with adult clients,\nand should engage in age-appropriate preparation of child clients.\n(b) A CIT should comply with any limits on the scope of his/her testimony, which\nhave been specified by a judicial officer in conjunction with any applicable\nethical code.\n28\n(c) A CIT should anticipate that clients, attorneys, and the Court may ask the CIT\nto testify beyond the limits of his or her knowledge and role. The CIT should\nrespectfully decline to provide information or opinions that exceed the\ntreatment role or the CIT’s knowledge base.\n(d) A CIT should seek to clarify any conflicts between the testimony requested by\nthe Court or counsel and any limitations imposed by professional ethics codes\nor licensing regulations.\n(e) When the CIT is designated as an Expert Witness by the Court he or she may\noffer relevant clinical opinions within the role of the treating expert.\n(1) The CIT may offer opinions on issues such as diagnosis, changes or\nbehaviors observed in treatment, treatment plan, prognosis, coping and\ndevelopmental abilities, conditions necessary for effective treatment,\netc.\n(2) The CIT should not render opinions on psycho-legal issues (e.g.,\nparental capacity, child custody, validity of an abuse allegation, joint\nor sole custody), as these are beyond the scope of the treatment role\nand properly the province of other professionals and the Court\n29\nAPPENDIX A\nRESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA\nThis material is intended to supplement the information in Guidelines 7 and 8.7 regarding\nprivilege and confidentiality issues, and the clinical management of requests for treatment\nrecords or information.\n1. A subpoena is not a Court order. It is a formal request from an attorney to summon a\nwitness or require a witness to bring documents to a hearing. The hearing might be a\ndeposition (oral testimony taken under oath in preparation for a formal trial or to preserve\nthe evidence) or a trial itself.\n2. A CIT should never ignore a subpoena.\n3. A CIT should not assume that a subpoena requires him or her to automatically disclose\nall requested information\n4. Some jurisdictions have detailed statutes regarding psychotherapist privilege. These may\ninclude specific statutorily-mandated steps the CIT can take in response to receipt of a\nsubpoena. In other jurisdictions, a CIT may want to obtain legal advice from an attorney\nfamiliar with (1) the privacy law in that jurisdiction; (2) the requirements specific to\nfamily court cases or the laws governing the CIT’s role; and (3) the ethical obligations of\nmental health professionals. It is important for each CIT to know the state of the law in\nhis or her jurisdiction on this issue and for the CIT to provide his/her counsel with any\nspecific orders governing the CIT’s role in the particular case.\n5. The requirements for responding to a subpoena may be different in a juvenile or\ndependency court, a family court, a general civil court and a criminal court. When\nobtaining legal counsel with regard to a subpoena, the CIT should know which type of\ncourt is the setting for the case that generated the subpoena and should provide legal\ncounsel with all relevant orders and documents.\n6. If a CIT receives a subpoena regarding an adult client’s treatment, he or she should make\nand document best efforts to notify the client or former client that the subpoena was\nserved. The CIT should let the client know the scope of the information sought in the\nsubpoena and that the client has a right to consult counsel to determine how best to\nrespond to the subpoena.\n7. If the subpoena was sent by the client’s attorney, the CIT may, with the written consent\nof the client, cooperate with the attorney.\n8. If the subpoena was sent by opposing counsel, the CIT may, with the written consent of\nthe client, cooperate with the client’s attorney to design a strategy for response to the\nsubpoena.\n30\n9. In working with the client’s attorney, it is important for the CIT to learn what the attorney\nhopes to gain from the CIT’s involvement in (or exclusion from) the case, the issues\nbeing litigated, and the information and/or opinions that the lawyer will ask the CIT to\nreveal. The CIT should also attempt to learn what the opposing side is trying to achieve\nand whether and in what way the opposing lawyer may attempt to discredit the CIT’s\ninformation and/or opinions.\n10. Upon receipt of the subpoena, the CIT should carefully review his or her own records\nregarding the client and be prepared to discuss with the client and his or her attorney the\nfollowing:\nA. Whether the record contains outdated material;\nB. Whether the record contains highly personal material;\nC. Whether the record contains information that could help the client achieve the\ngoals described by the client’s attorney;\nD. Whether the record contains information that could harm the client’s goals.\n11. If the subpoena was sent by the opposing attorney, the CIT should discuss with the\nclient’s attorney whether or not it would be useful to attempt to negotiate with opposing\nattorney to limit the scope of the subpoena, e.g., to redact outdated material, the names of\nthird parties not important to the litigation or highly personal information.\n12. The CIT should discuss with the client’s attorney whether or not it would be wise to bring\na Motion to Quash the subpoena, i.e., a request of the Court that the CIT be relieved of\nthe obligation to provide testimony or produce records. The Motion to Quash must be\ngrounded in some legally-cognizable rationale. For example, the material known to the\nCIT may not be relevant to the litigation. Or the opposition might be able to obtain the\ninformation known by the CIT from other sources, which would be less invasive to the\nclient than obtaining information from the CIT. Or in some jurisdictions it will be\npossible to argue that, even though the CIT has information bearing on the case, it is\nmore important that the client’s privacy be maintained than that the information be\ndisclosed.\n13. If a child is the CIT’s client and the child’s records are subpoenaed, the CIT should\nconsider whether or not the potential consequences to the child warrant opposing release\nof the information, requesting that an independent advocate be appointed, or warning the\ninvolved parties about risks to the child from release of the information. The CIT should\nbe familiar with the procedures in his or her jurisdiction that are used to protect or\nconsider the child’s treatment information. In most jurisdictions, under ordinary\ncircumstances, the parents or the person with legal custody of the child or the legal\nguardian has the power to determine whether or not to allow a child’s private information\nto be released. However, if the parents are themselves in conflict in the litigation, the\njurisdiction may have a special process for determining the child’s privacy rights (as the\nparents are in a conflict of interest position about the child’s privacy rights). Some\njurisdictions will have a procedure by which a specially appointed person will decide,\n31\nafter learning more about the litigation and the effects on the child, whether to waive or\nto assert the child’s privilege. In some jurisdictions the decision of that appointee is\ndecisive; in other jurisdictions, the person’s decision is a recommendation to the Court,\nwhich has the final say.\n14. If the CIT is asked to give information or an opinion about the effect on the child client of\nrelease of treatment information, the CIT should be prepared to explain the potential\nimpact on the child of releasing the information and, conversely, the potential impact of\nwithholding the information and the risks and benefits of each. Relevant factors might\ninclude the child’s wishes, the impact of the decision on the child’s ability to trust therapy\nand the CIT following a disclosure, the child’s needs or ability to have his or her voice\nheard in the litigation, and whether or not there are other, less intrusive sources for\nobtaining the information.\n15. The CIT should be aware that ultimate decisions regarding release of treatment\ninformation may not be the province of the therapist. Properly informed adults, and their\nattorneys, may have the right to control their treatment information. Those charged with\nprotecting the child, such a minor’s counsel, Guardian Ad Litem or the Court, may need\nto weigh and determine the best means of protecting the child’s interests.\n32\nFor supplemental information, please see the following documents:\nSample client-therapist contract:\nhttp://www.afccnet.org/Portals/0/PublicDocuments/guidelines/Client-therapistcontract.pdf\nSample order for counseling:\nhttp://www.afccnet.org/Portals/0/PublicDocuments/guidelines/OrderforCounseling.pdf\nSample stipulation and order for counseling:\nhttp://www.afccnet.org/Portals/0/PublicDocuments/guidelines/StipulationandorderforCounseling.pdf\nSuggested references:\nhttp://www.afccnet.org/Portals/0/PublicDocuments/guidelines/Suggestedreferences.pdf",
