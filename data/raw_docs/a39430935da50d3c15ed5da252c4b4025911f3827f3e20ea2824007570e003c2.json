DR-2023-900051.01\nBRITTANY MICHELLE GILLILAND )\nDEFENDANT/PETITIONER )\nMOTION FOR REUNIFICATION COUNSELOR\nComes now the Plaintiff/Respondent, Christopher Blaine McGregor, by and through his\nattorney, Dianne James Davis, and files this Motion for Reunification Counselor for reunification\ntherapy and would state as follows:\n1. That Counselor, Kelly Turner has provided an Affidavit to the Court as she could not appear\non February 13, 2025;\n2. That in the Affidavit, Kelly Turner has reached conclusions regarding the Father with having\nonly email interaction;\n3. That Kelly Turner made very prejudicial statements regarding the Father in her Affidavit\nwithout having any conversation or in person meeting;\n4. That Counsel for the Father plans to call Kelly Turner as a witness at the next hearing as she\nwas unable to cross examine her “Affidavit”.\n5. That in Kelly Turner’s Affidavit, she states that “As a professional, with 25 years of\nexperience and over 100 cases working with custody/divorce/alienation, this situation\nfelt highly manipulative and as a professional, I realized that this process was not going\nto be conducive, nor effective, and a decision was made to withdrawal”.\n6. That the Father feels a fresh start with a new counselor would be in the best interest of the\nminor child, A.K.M. and Mother.\n7. That as of the last email correspondence with Kelly Turner, she withdrew – a copy attached\nas EXHIBIT A.\n8. That the Father had NEVER allowed his daughter to miss any of these appointments and has\nre-arranged other doctor’s appointments to make the appointment with Mrs. Turner.\nDOCUMENT 153\n9. That the Father has reason to believe the Mother has moved in with her boyfriend in Clanton,\nAlabama, without proper notice. That the Mother now works in Clanton and that due to the\nlimited meetings with the Mother, child, and Kelly Turner, the Father does not feel the\ntherapy has not gotten in depth to the point it would detrimental. That it would be more\nconvenient for the mother and child for a Reunification Expert in the Birmingham area which\nwould be to the Mother’s home and work.\n10. In light of the Affidavit of Kelly Turner filed with this Court on February 12, 2025, the Father\nfeels that a therapist that can be effective in the reunification process.\n11. That on Kelly Turner’s website, nowhere does it list reunification therapy, although the\nMother’s attorney stated many times that Kelly Turner is an “EXPERT” in reunification\ntherapy. See Exhibit “B”\n12. That Counsel for Father would recommend Caroline Taylor, located in Homewood, Alabama.\nThat Mrs. Taylor is an expert in reunification therapy and a highly respected Counselor. That\nMrs. Taylor’s website lists her many services, one of which is Reunification Services:\nWhen a parent loses contact with a child for any reason the court may order\nreunification therapy. In this form of family therapy, I work with the children and\nparents on healing relationships in the family system. Information attached at Exhibit\n“C”.\nWHEREFORE, the premises considered, and due to the fathe the former counselor has\nwithdrawn, the Plaintiff/Father request this Honorable Court appoint Caroline Taylor, a specialist\nin reunification for the mother and child.\nRespectfully submitted this the 14th day of February, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, Alabama 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (Facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nDOCUMENT 153\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing in the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 14th day of February, 2025.\nBarbara H.
