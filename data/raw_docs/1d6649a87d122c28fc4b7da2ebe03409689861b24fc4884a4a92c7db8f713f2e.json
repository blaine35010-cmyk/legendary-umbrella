Dr. Tyler, would you state your full\n22 name, please, sir?\n23 A. Eric Owen Tyler.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n8\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. And you're a practicing physician\n2 here in Alexander City?\n3 A. Yes, I am.\n4 Q. And how long have you been practicing\n5 as a pediatrician?\n6 A. 40 years in Alex City.\n7 Q. All right, sir. And where did you go\n8 to medical school?\n9 A. I went to the University of Tennessee\n10 in Memphis.\n11 Q. And after medical school, what, if\n12 any, education did you have?\n13 A. I did a pediatric residency at\n14 Children's of Alabama from 1981 to 1984. And\n15 I stayed as a part of the faculty and ran the\n16 critical care transport services there as\n17 well as the residency program from '84 to\n18 '85. I moved here in June of 1985, and I've\n19 been practicing here since.\n20 Q. Okay, sir. And would you have any\n21 guess as to how many patients you may have\n22 seen since then?\n23 A. Well, that's an interesting question,\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n9\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Mr. Clayton. I do keep up with that. I\n2 can't say personally, but the practice has\n3 seen well over 940,000 patients in those 40\n4 years.\n5 Q. Wow. And you practice in the name\n6 of...\n7 A. Pediatric Associates of Alexander\n8 City.\n9 Q. All right, sir. And are there any\n10 other physicians in the practice?\n11 A. Dr. Arnold Tauro. And then we also\n12 have associated with us four nurse\n13 practitioners.\n14 Q. All right, sir. In that capacity,\n15 have you, or Pediatric Associates, had the\n16 opportunity to treat or see Miss Adeline Kate\n17 McGregor?\n18 A. We have.\n19 Q. And when do your records show you\n20 first saw her?\n21 A. We have been her medical home since\n22 birth. So we go that far back.\n23 Q. All right. Well, let me -- the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n10\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 records I have start in January of -- January\n2 7th of 2022.\n3 A. Well, we changed medical records a\n4 couple of times, but I'm pretty sure we've\n5 taken care of her the majority of her life.\n6 Q. All right, sir. I've asked you to\n7 bring your file with you. Do you have that\n8 file?\n9 A. I only have the file of the visits\n10 that I provided for her.\n11 Q. That's fine.\n12 A. That -- there were other visits done\n13 with Dr. Tauro at another office.\n14 Q. Okay, sir. Well, let's just use\n15 yours. What date are you showing as your\n16 first visit?\n17 A. My first visit with her was December\n18 the 5th of 2024.\n19 Q. Okay, sir. Let me -- give me just a\n20 second and let me catch up with you.\n21 A. I saw her intermittently for acute\n22 interventional visits, like sicknesses and\n23 things like that. But it -- it wasn't very\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n11\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 often.\n2 Q. Okay. Let's see. But y'all have\n3 seen her off and on through the years --\n4 A. Yes, sir.\n5 Q. -- for different matters, illnesses?\n6 A. Usual childhood, as well as wellness\n7 visits.\n8 Q. And I saw she had an injury at one\n9 time, some kind of sports injury I think\n10 y'all treated for her.\n11 Okay. You saw her on 12/05/24; is\n12 that correct?\n13 A. That's correct.\n14 Q. And what complaints, if any, did she\n15 present with on that day?\n16 A. She presented with her father with a\n17 history of struggles in school that were both\n18 academic as well as some emotional struggles.\n19 Q. All right, sir. And did you get a\n20 history on her or her family on this day?\n21 A. I did.\n22 Q. And would you tell us what that is?\n23 A. Well, she began to have struggles\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n12\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 with her focus in the third grade.\n2 MS. AGRICOLA: Well, I'm sorry\n3 to interrupt. I would like to object\n4 as to hearsay.\n5 MR. CLAYTON: Oh, that's fine.\n6 Okay.\n7 MS. AGRICOLA: Yeah, you can\n8 answer. But I want to make sure I\n9 put my objection on the Record.\n10 MR. CLAYTON: Okay.\n11 BY MR. CLAYTON:\n12 Q. You may answer.\n13 A. I'm a physician, and this is the\n14 history I was given.\n15 Q. Yes.\n16 A. Okay.\n17 Q. And do you know who you got it from?\n18 A. The Father.\n19 Q. The Father. Okay. Go ahead, Doctor.\n20 A. She was struggling, and it had been\n21 an issue in school since the third grade.\n22 She had poor focus, poor comprehension, poor\n23 retention. She was able to pass the grade\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n13\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 only with extra credit work and homework that\n2 the teachers allowed her to complete.\n3 And the teachers noted the\n4 struggles even the year before that allowing\n5 and retaking tests even as open-book tests.\n6 The other history was the routine\n7 history. She was term gestation. She had\n8 had a surgical procedure, tonsillectomy,\n9 adenoidectomy. She had had a history of a\n10 concussion and a broken arm. Her\n11 developmental milestones were met and intact.\n12 And her school history, her Pre-K\n13 work did well. She in first and second grade\n14 didn't have any problems. But in the third\n15 grade, that's when her struggles began. Her\n16 grades dropped.\n17 In the sixth grade, she had been --\n18 and in the fourth grade she had been allowed\n19 to join the Beta Club, but she lost that\n20 status because of grades in the fifth and\n21 sixth grade. And the current year was\n22 currently the seventh grade, and her scores\n23 were -- were low.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n14\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay, sir. And on your history --\n2 well, let me strike that.\n3 I'm looking at your records. It\n4 said she showed up with some sleep issues; is\n5 that right?\n6 A. Yes. Her bedtime was about nine\n7 o'clock, but she felt like that she has a\n8 hard time going to sleep. And according to\n9 the patient, she felt like she was scared.\n10 And at that point, scared of what?\n11 And she mentioned that she had fear of her\n12 mother and thoughts of what will she do next.\n13 And that's a direct quote.\n14 Q. All right, sir.\n15 MS. AGRICOLA: And if I may\n16 interrupt. For the court reporter,\n17 I'd just like to make a standing\n18 objection for all questions, a\n19 standing objection to hearsay for all\n20 questions that evoke a response that\n21 is the statement of anyone other than\n22 the party.\n23 So just if you'll notate,\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n15\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Ms. Lanier, the standing objection\n2 for hearsay as to what he's\n3 responding. I don't want that to be\n4 waived in any way.\n5 MR. CLAYTON: Barbi, are we\n6 using usual stipulations?\n7 MS. AGRICOLA: That was not\n8 asked. And so I'm handling it as if\n9 we are not. So I'm objecting based\n10 on trial objections to ensure that\n11 that's preserved.\n12 MR. CLAYTON: I'm a little\n13 rusty on these, but my recollection\n14 is when we do it under usual\n15 objections, that usually means to me\n16 anyway that we reserve all objections\n17 for the trial with the exception of\n18 as to form.\n19 MS. AGRICOLA: Right.\n20 MR. CLAYTON: Okay. All right.\n21 Just to make sure we're on the same\n22 channel.\n23 MS. AGRICOLA: Sure. But we\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n16\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 didn't -- unless I missed it, I don't\n2 believe we --\n3 THE COURT REPORTER: Barbi, I'm\n4 sorry. That was my fault trying to\n5 rush us up.\n6 MS. AGRICOLA: Oh, you're fine.\n7 THE COURT REPORTER: I should\n8 have asked usual stipulations at the\n9 beginning of the deposition.\n10 MS. AGRICOLA: Okay. Then,\n11 yeah, that's the only thing that --\n12 the only reason I'm doing that is I\n13 just don't want it to be waived.\n14 So if we want to do usual\n15 stipulations other than object to\n16 form, we can do that going forward,\n17 and I don't have to interrupt\n18 Dr. Tyler as frequently.\n19 My apologies, Dr. Tyler.\n20 MR. CLAYTON: That's fine.\n21 Thank you. Anything else, Barbi?\n22 MS. AGRICOLA: No.\n23 MR. CLAYTON: Okay. Thank you.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n17\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 BY MR. CLAYTON:\n2 Q. Okay, Doctor. You may continue.\n3 A. The question you had posed was about\n4 sleep. And once she negotiated sleep, she\n5 seemed to sleep pretty well. But she did\n6 have some dreams about some random things.\n7 Q. Okay. And on your history, I see\n8 you've got a history of the Father and the\n9 Mother.\n10 A. I did.\n11 Q. And did you -- I'm assuming, you\n12 correct me if I'm wrong, the Father related\n13 his history directly to you?\n14 A. Correct, he did.\n15 Q. And what about the Mother's history\n16 do you have?\n17 A. The Mother's history was provided by\n18 the Father.\n19 Q. Okay. I understand -- would you tell\n20 us what was related to you?\n21 A. The Mother was 36 years of age. She\n22 had no struggles in school. She obtained a\n23 master's degree in education. And her\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n18\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 current situation was she had been dismissed\n2 from our local community college for\n3 uncertain reasons.\n4 Q. All right, sir. And was anything\n5 related to you in the history as to custody\n6 of the Child?\n7 A. Yeah. The Father had custody of the\n8 Child at the time of the gathering.\n9 Q. Okay. Was there any reason given as\n10 to why he had custody?\n11 A. That Father related that the Mother\n12 was removed from the home after child abuse\n13 of the patient was discovered. And he\n14 related that it was physical corporal\n15 punishment without provocation.\n16 Q. Okay, sir. Thank you. Did you have\n17 any diagnosis once you examined her and got\n18 all of this information?\n19 A. We used two standardized tests. One\n20 of those were Vanderbilt Rating Scores for\n21 ADHD that both had a parent as well as two\n22 teachers. And we also used a standardized\n23 form that's an acronym, SCARD, S-C-A-R-D,\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n19\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that is a form used to measure levels of\n2 anxiety in children. And both of those had\n3 significant findings.\n4 Q. Okay. And is this test -- is that an\n5 objective type test? Or --\n6 A. It is a subjective test.\n7 Q. Okay, sir. But the results were\n8 what?\n9 A. I'm not sure that those scales made\n10 it here. Well, they might be in here. Yes,\n11 that's it.\n12 Q. Is that the one?\n13 A. That's the one, uh-huh. The result\n14 of the SCARD test was 17. And the rating on\n15 that was moderate to severe depression. That\n16 would be a score rating of 15 to 19.\n17 Q. Okay, sir.\n18 A. And those were -- again, that's a\n19 standardized testing form.\n20 Q. And did you render any treatment or\n21 recommendation for treatment?\n22 A. Based on the history and also the\n23 objective testing that was performed, her\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n20\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 standardized testing that was performed, we\n2 started her on a medication called Jornay,\n3 which is a methylphenidate product, to try to\n4 manage the symptoms of ADHD.\n5 And we started her on Lexapro,\n6 which is a serotonin synaptic uptake\n7 inhibitor, to help with the symptoms of\n8 anxiety.\n9 She also related that she had\n10 episodes of rapid heart rate, of sweating, of\n11 not being able to think that we thought were\n12 consistent with panic attacks.\n13 Q. All right.\n14 A. Propranolol was provided as an every\n15 now and then, on occasion medication, which\n16 is also an accepted medicine in patients her\n17 age to try to manage symptoms of tachycardia\n18 associated with panic attacks.\n19 Q. All right, sir. And when did you\n20 next see Adeline, or Adeline?\n21 A. She was next seen back in 14 days\n22 later.\n23 Q. All right, sir. My copy is showing\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n21\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 December the 19th of 2024.\n2 A. Affirmative.\n3 Q. Okay, sir. And on that day, did she\n4 show any or have any complaints?\n5 A. Well, she came back for an assessment\n6 of what the intervention with these\n7 medications have provided for her, what was\n8 the outcome. That was the whole purpose of\n9 coming back together.\n10 Q. All right, sir. And what -- and on\n11 this visit, what were your findings?\n12 A. Well, the patient stated that her\n13 feeling was that both of these medications\n14 had been very beneficial to her.\n15 She felt like that her focus had\n16 improved. Her retention had improved. She\n17 felt like that her efforts in school had\n18 become much more efficient. And that was\n19 evidenced by specific questions about how\n20 long does it take for you to do your\n21 homework, and she felt like she had become\n22 more efficient.\n23 She also felt like she was able to\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n22\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 start and complete tasks without being -- her\n2 attention being scattered and going somewhere\n3 else.\n4 She felt that the dose of the\n5 medication had worked pretty well for her but\n6 felt like it didn't last long enough in the\n7 entire day. She felt like the panic attacks\n8 and anxiety attacks had been significantly\n9 improved with the exception of -- and this is\n10 a direct quote from her -- when I have to go\n11 see the counselor with my mother, that makes\n12 me have a panic attack because she lies. A\n13 direct quote from the patient.\n14 Q. Let me ask you this, Dr. Tyler. What\n15 are the symptoms of a panic attack?\n16 A. It usually starts with a feeling of\n17 impending doom, and then it's followed by a\n18 sympathetic nervous system response of rapid\n19 heart rate, rapid breathing. You can have a\n20 release of epinephrine that causes both of\n21 those things. Thus, she can begin to have --\n22 break out in a sweat and feel cold. And it\n23 can last for varying periods of time.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n23\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Would these panic attacks, is that\n2 detrimental to the Child?\n3 A. Brief episodes of tachycardia we\n4 encounter when we run or when we exercise.\n5 So, physically, no.\n6 But, emotionally, panic attacks can\n7 be devastating to the person who is\n8 experiencing them. It doesn't matter how old\n9 they are.\n10 Q. Yes, sir. And were you able through\n11 any of your testing or observation of Adeline\n12 or even with conversation with her, have you\n13 been able to determine the source of this\n14 anxiety and panic attacks?\n15\n16 (Witness' phone ringing.)\n17\n18 A. I'm going to have to be pardoned here\n19 because I am on-call, and this is the\n20 hospital.\n21 Q. Oh, okay.\n22\n23 (Short break.)\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n24\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 (The question was read back by\n2 the court reporter.)\n3\n4 A. She felt like that it was -- she --\n5 my understanding from her was that she felt\n6 like this was related to what had happened to\n7 her, that adverse childhood experience, and\n8 that she still had fear of being around her\n9 mother.\n10 Q. All right, sir. Thank you. On this\n11 visit -- and, again, we're talking December\n12 the 19th of '24 -- did either one of the\n13 parents or both accompany her on this visit?\n14 A. Her father was there initially. Her\n15 mother showed up about 15 minutes into the\n16 appointment.\n17 And then I really asked that we try\n18 to keep the conversation all about helping\n19 the Child and not about any conflict that was\n20 ongoing. And I got a consensus from both\n21 that -- that would take place.\n22 And we tried to go through what we\n23 had discussed this, the testing that had been\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n25\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 done that led to the diagnosis, the\n2 intervention, the strategies behind the\n3 intervention.\n4 And then we were talking about the\n5 outcomes, especially the way the patient felt\n6 since taking this medication.\n7 Q. Did the Mother disagree with your\n8 approach to treatment of Adeline?\n9 A. Absolutely. She asked that the Child\n10 be excused from the room. She stated she did\n11 not understand why the Child was being\n12 treated with medication.\n13 I reiterated a second time the\n14 decision making. Mother tried to state that\n15 all the symptoms began when the Father\n16 assumed custody of the Child.\n17 However, when reminded, Mom agreed\n18 that the ADHD symptoms and anxiety began in\n19 the third grade. She acknowledged that that\n20 was like that.\n21 She then stated that the Child had\n22 gotten much worse since starting the\n23 medication even though the Child didn't feel\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n26\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that to be true. She stated that -- that the\n2 medications had been beneficial.\n3 The Father's observations confirmed\n4 that as well as the teachers' observations.\n5 They all confirmed the same thing. That the\n6 medications had had a beneficial impact\n7 rather than a detrimental impact.\n8 The Mother claimed that those were\n9 not her observations, at which point the\n10 Father questioned how she had been able to\n11 make those observations because of limited\n12 exposure to the Child.\n13 And Mother stated the Child should\n14 be under the care of a psychiatrist,\n15 especially since she was on, quote, high\n16 doses of medications. And she really isn't\n17 on high doses of those medications.\n18 The conversation is then turned\n19 back to why she was on the medications for\n20 the third time. Same question asked for the\n21 third time. And everybody sees she is much\n22 worse on these medications. And these are\n23 direct quotes from the Mother.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n27\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 When attempting to answer the\n2 question the third time, the Mother then\n3 began to make the allegation that the Father\n4 was seeking meds like this so he could sell\n5 these medications in a felonious manner.\n6 It was apparent that the Mother had\n7 a focus on something other than our baseline\n8 agreement, which was on the state of the\n9 Child. And I terminated the conversation\n10 with the Mother at that point because it felt\n11 like it was becoming an uncontrolled\n12 situation.\n13 Q. Okay. Did you recommend any course\n14 of treatment at this visit?\n15 A. Well, we went up on her morning dose\n16 of her medication which was Metadate CD.\n17 Because according to the patient, she felt\n18 like it was not lasting long enough.\n19 And we left the Lexapro and -- as a\n20 daily medication, and then we requested to\n21 follow up in eight weeks time.\n22 Q. All right, sir. Anything else occur\n23 that you're aware of on that visit that we\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n28\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 haven't talked about?\n2 A. Other than -- I don't believe so.\n3 Q. Okay. Thank you. When did you next\n4 see her?\n5 A. I saw her next on the 9th day of\n6 January of 2025.\n7 Q. All right, sir. Is this a follow-up\n8 visit?\n9 A. A follow-up visit.\n10 Q. And any complaints that she still had\n11 on this visit?\n12 A. Well, it was a follow-up visit for\n13 her ADHD, her anxiety, her panic attacks.\n14 And she presented with her father. In the\n15 interim time period, the Metadate CD dose had\n16 been increased to 30 milligrams. That is not\n17 going to be in a medical record. That was\n18 just discussions in the patient portal.\n19 According to the patient and the\n20 Father, the school performance was\n21 significantly improved. At home, she was\n22 much less anxious, more interactive.\n23 Symptoms of depression including\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n29\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 anhedonia and hopelessness had decreased.\n2 Her anxiety is only an issue situationally\n3 when she has to be around her mother in any\n4 setting.\n5 And the Father notes more\n6 spontaneous activities around the home, up\n7 and engaging in family activities together.\n8 We repeated a test for depression\n9 called a PHQ-9, and it had dropped -- well,\n10 it had dropped from 17 to 14 with only about\n11 three to four weeks on Lexapro, and that is a\n12 significant reduction.\n13 The teachers had noted improvements\n14 in school, and grades had begun to improve.\n15 And it was felt by both the patient and her\n16 father there were no medication side effects,\n17 and they felt like that this regimen was\n18 covering the day very well.\n19 Q. Is she still having the issue with\n20 the panic attacks?\n21 A. Only if she was going to be around\n22 her mother.\n23 Q. Okay, sir. Would you feel in your\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n30\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 medical opinion then that it would be in the\n2 best interest of this child to minimize the\n3 contact with the Mother from a health\n4 standpoint?\n5 MS. AGRICOLA: I'm going to\n6 object to that. I'm going to object\n7 to that question and ask that he not\n8 answer that. That's the ultimate\n9 issue.\n10 I know we're doing object\n11 to the form, but that's for the Judge\n12 to -- the Judge to determine.\n13 MR. CLAYTON: Barbi, I hate to\n14 ask you this. We've got a little\n15 buzzing in the room, a little\n16 background noise, and this thing is\n17 turned away from me.\n18 So would you mind repeating\n19 the objection? I couldn't hear the\n20 last part.\n21 MS. AGRICOLA: I was saying I\n22 object to that question. I know we\n23 are doing usual stipulations which\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n31\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 would be me just objecting to form.\n2 But that question\n3 specifically calls for an ultimate\n4 conclusion on custodial\n5 determination, which is for the Judge\n6 and the Judge alone.\n7 So that would be an\n8 improper question.\n9 MR. CLAYTON: I understand.\n10 BY MR. CLAYTON:\n11 Q. You may answer, Dr. Tyler. If\n12 you -- do you remember the question?\n13 A. I do.\n14 Q. Okay.\n15 A. The whole history of Adverse\n16 Childhood Experiences was documented by two\n17 doctors, Anda and Felitti, in 1997.\n18 And since then, they have come up\n19 with 10 different adverse childhood\n20 experiencing that include physical abuse,\n21 emotional abuse, sexual abuse, feeling\n22 unwanted, feeling like their needs are not\n23 met, having a parent with a mental illness,\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n32\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 being divorced, a parent that's been\n2 incarcerated, parents that have drug issues.\n3 Having four of those knocks 20\n4 years off your life. And repetitive -- and\n5 being exposed to stressful adverse childhood\n6 experiences repetitively tends to make those\n7 things worse.\n8 So I think that the answer to your\n9 question is would be I think this child is in\n10 the safest environment in the care of the\n11 Father.\n12 Q. Thank you. Did you see her again,\n13 Doctor?\n14 A. I saw her again on the 11th of April\n15 of this year.\n16 Q. And what were the complaints at that\n17 time?\n18 A. It was a --\n19 MS. AGRICOLA: And, actually,\n20 may I interrupt again? I'm sorry. I\n21 do not have any documentation of an\n22 April 2025 visit.\n23 So if you -- and I see\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n33\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 you've been reviewing his notes as to\n2 other previous notes from the other\n3 visits. But I do not have an April\n4 2025. So if you're going to question\n5 or reference them in any way, ask\n6 that they be provided to me.\n7 MR. CLAYTON: Let me rephrase\n8 my question, and we may be able so\n9 solve that problem for you.\n10 MS. AGRICOLA: Okay.\n11 BY MR. CLAYTON:\n12 Q. Doctor, I don't have that date\n13 either. Do your records show that you saw\n14 her in regard to the panic attacks or anxiety\n15 after January the 9th of 2025?\n16 A. Yes.\n17 Q. All right, sir.\n18 A. This was a wellness visit is probably\n19 why you didn't get that one.\n20 Q. Oh, okay.\n21 A. We won't reference that. I'm missing\n22 one. It was on August the 1st of this year.\n23 Q. All right, sir. And what was the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n34\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 nature of that visit?\n2 A. It was a medication followup. She\n3 had gone from the visit, the last visit and\n4 that according to me was a wellness visit.\n5 She had gone the summer.\n6 And this was to get back together\n7 right as school was beginning to see how\n8 things had gone for her during the summer.\n9 Q. All right, sir. And what were the\n10 results?\n11 A. At that point, she was on a\n12 methylphenidate product called Jornay that's\n13 given at night. And she was still taking the\n14 Lexapro 10 milligrams. Those were the only\n15 two medications she took.\n16 Prior to starting these\n17 medications, she had experienced difficulty\n18 with focus, racing thoughts, daytime\n19 sleepiness which negatively impacted her\n20 academic performance, her ability to retain\n21 information.\n22 She described herself as being\n23 unable to concentrate in class with\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n35\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 information, in quotes, going in one ear and\n2 out the other, often falling asleep during\n3 the day.\n4 And after the initiation of\n5 stimulants and the Lexapro, there had been\n6 marked ability -- improvement in her ability\n7 to concentrate, retain information and\n8 participate in class.\n9 She reports being -- reported being\n10 able to memorize content, take effective\n11 notes, study, which resulted in a substantial\n12 improvement in her grades, including going --\n13 achieving nearly all \"A\" grades, receiving\n14 the AB Honor Roll recognition.\n15 She noted that her mind was no\n16 longer racing. She was able to complete\n17 thoughts and tasks more efficiently. There\n18 had been a significant reduction in daytime\n19 sleepiness and academic stress.\n20 During the course of the summer,\n21 she participated in cheer. She went to a\n22 cheer competition. Her team received first\n23 place in sideline dance, first place in\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n36\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 dance, first place overall in cheer, first --\n2 and first in the junior/varsity divisions.\n3 And she was chosen as a seventh grader by the\n4 UCA as sort of an honor cheer student.\n5 And when she returned, she was\n6 chosen as a seventh grader as the head of the\n7 junior high school squad. That's remarkable.\n8 Q. Okay.\n9 A. Especially for a girl who had\n10 significant anxiety.\n11 Q. Have you seen her since then? And\n12 what was the date on that, Doctor?\n13 A. August the 1st of 2025.\n14 Q. All right, sir.\n15 A. I have not seen her since then.\n16 Q. Okay.\n17 A. Things were going so well there\n18 wasn't a reason to.\n19 Q. Great. I mean, that's great.\n20 Doctor, these records that we've looked at,\n21 are those kept in the normal course of your\n22 business?\n23 A. Yes, sir, they are.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n37\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. And are they true and correct --\n2 A. They are.\n3 Q. -- to the best of your knowledge?\n4\n5 (Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 1\n6 was marked for identification\n7 purposes by Mr. Clayton.)\n8\n9 MR. CLAYTON: I would like to\n10 admit Dr. Tyler's file into the\n11 Record as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.\n12 MS. AGRICOLA: I'm going to\n13 object. I would object to any\n14 document -- one, I can't see what his\n15 file is, and you just said the file.\n16 I'm going to object to any\n17 admission of documents after the\n18 January 9th, 2025 visit. Those were\n19 not provided. They have not been\n20 provided to me in advance of this\n21 deposition.\n22 But I do not object to\n23 the -- if they are the notes for the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n38\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 doctor's visit from November 5th,\n2 December 19th and then January 9th,\n3 2025. I do not object to the\n4 admission of those.\n5 I think it would probably\n6 be smarter if we break them up into\n7 multiple exhibits as opposed to one\n8 giant exhibit. So that might be\n9 wiser for reference purposes of the\n10 deposition transcript.\n11 MR. CLAYTON: Okay.\n12 BY MR. CLAYTON:\n13 Q. Doctor, thank you. That's all the\n14 questions I have.\n15\n16 EXAMINATION\n17 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n18 Q. Dr. Tyler, I represent the Mother,\n19 Brittany Gilliland. And I'm just asking you\n20 questions. Let me ask you. Don't you have\n21 an employee at your office, Katie McGregor?\n22 Isn't that an employee at your\n23 office?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n39\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Yes.\n2 Q. Okay. And do you know the\n3 relationship of her and Blaine McGregor?\n4 A. That's her sister-in-law, brother-in-\n5 law relationship.\n6 Q. Okay. And Katie McGregor has been\n7 involved in the scheduling and notification\n8 and contact with the parent, with the Child's\n9 parents; is that correct?\n10 A. Put a time reference on that, ma'am.\n11 I'm not going to answer that question the way\n12 you posed it.\n13 Q. Well, unfortunately, I -- I mean, I\n14 can put a timetable on it. Generally\n15 speaking, from the fall of 2024 until\n16 present, has Katie McGregor been involved in\n17 any fashion related to this child?\n18 And let me clarify. That could be\n19 with contacting the either parent, whether or\n20 not a parent is prevented from being in an\n21 appointment, anything whatsoever.\n22 Has Katie McGregor had access or\n23 been involved in any way with this child?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n40\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 MR. CLAYTON: I'm going to\n2 object to the form of that. Doctor,\n3 answer if you can.\n4 A. My -- my organization has two\n5 completely different physical plants.\n6 Q. Yes, sir.\n7 A. Ms. McGregor works in Kellyton,\n8 Alabama. This child was not seen in\n9 Kellyton, Alabama, on any of the visits from\n10 December forward.\n11 And she did not schedule any\n12 appointments. She did not request any\n13 refills. Categorically, I deny and I'm\n14 offended by the way you asked that question.\n15 Q. Okay. Well, I'm certainly not trying\n16 to offend you. But, you know, I have staff\n17 who interact with my clients. And so I think\n18 it makes sense that your staff would interact\n19 with your patients. So that's the purpose of\n20 my questioning.\n21 A. This question was going to come up.\n22 We knew it. And that's why I feel so\n23 strongly in my answer.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n41\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. You are aware that the Child\n2 has been seen at that location where Katie\n3 McGregor worked; isn't that correct?\n4 A. That's why I asked you the time\n5 status, ma'am. Yes, she was seen up there\n6 prior to December of '24. Yes.\n7 Q. Okay.\n8 A. But since then --\n9 Q. And are you aware of --\n10 A. Since then she has not been seen up\n11 there.\n12 Q. In fact, she was seen in November of\n13 '24 at that location where Katie McGregor\n14 works, correct?\n15 A. Correct.\n16 Q. Okay. And at that visit, Katie\n17 McGregor -- Brittany was actually -- I'm\n18 sorry.\n19 At the November '24 visit, the\n20 Mother was requested to stand by the exit\n21 door; isn't that correct?\n22 A. Ma'am, I wasn't there. I don't know\n23 the answer to your question. That's a\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n42\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 completely --\n2 Q. You were informed.\n3 A. That was November 24th of -- that was\n4 in November of '24. That's a completely\n5 different office. I was not there. I don't\n6 know the answer to your question.\n7 Q. So you haven't been -- your staff\n8 didn't inform you about anything that\n9 happened at the November of 2024 visit?\n10 A. No. That's Dr. -- that's my partner,\n11 Dr. Tauro's office. I did not know anything\n12 about that.\n13 Q. Okay. So you're aware -- okay. Let\n14 me ask you this. You're obviously a\n15 pediatrician, correct?\n16 A. Yes.\n17 Q. Okay. Do you have any specialized\n18 training, certificates or residency or\n19 fellowships or anything like that related to\n20 psychiatry?\n21 A. I'm a part of Children's of Alabama\n22 Pediatric Access Telehealth Health Services.\n23 I've accomplished 128 hours of training\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n43\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 through them over the course of the last six\n2 years. And I have a certification that\n3 proves that.\n4 And it's -- the whole purpose of\n5 that is to allow rural pediatricians to do\n6 just what we're doing right now.\n7 Q. Okay. So then -- but you don't have\n8 a specialization in psychiatry, correct?\n9 A. I do not.\n10 Q. And you don't have a specialization\n11 in psychology, correct?\n12 A. I do not.\n13 Q. Okay. You don't have any -- or let\n14 me ask you this. Do you have any training in\n15 parental alienation between parties, between\n16 parents?\n17 A. Can you rephrase that question?\n18 Q. Okay. You're not familiar with the\n19 term \"parental alienation\"?\n20 A. No, ma'am. That's --\n21 Q. Okay.\n22 A. That's not -- that's more of a\n23 psychology thing. That's not -- that's not\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n44\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 an M.D. thing.\n2 Q. Okay. So, specifically, you have a\n3 specialization related to ADHD diagnosis; is\n4 that correct?\n5 A. It's a broad, a very broad stroke\n6 of -- these -- these things, we're having the\n7 first of the seventh year of these tomorrow.\n8 They talk about a broad stroke of things --\n9 how to manage ADHD, how to manage anxiety,\n10 how to manage panic attacks, how to screen\n11 for suicides, how to manage autism. The list\n12 goes on and on and on and on and on.\n13 Q. Sure. I certainly understand that in\n14 your practice and the training as a doctor\n15 and the schooling there you've got a broad\n16 knowledge of a lot of different things.\n17 But I thought you also had a\n18 specialization in behavior in ADHD. Am I\n19 incorrect in that?\n20 A. I've got a lot of experience in doing\n21 that. But the behavioral developmental\n22 pediatric degree was not available when I was\n23 doing my training.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n45\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. I see. Okay. And all the\n2 information related to -- let me -- it might\n3 be easier for me to go by visits, the notes.\n4 And let me ask you this. You were\n5 reading it appears -- and, of course, we're\n6 on Zoom. So it appeared from the video that\n7 you were reading from a document in front of\n8 you.\n9 Were those the visitation notes --\n10 A. Yes, they were.\n11 Q. -- for each visit?\n12 A. They were.\n13 Q. Okay. So let's look at the December\n14 5th, 2024 note. And that note -- in the\n15 questioning earlier, you said at that visit\n16 only the Father was present, correct?\n17 A. Correct.\n18 Q. And I believe you said you discussed\n19 academic struggles of the Child and emotional\n20 struggles, correct?\n21 A. Correct.\n22 Q. And all the history related to the\n23 Child came from the Father and the Child,\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n46\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 right?\n2 A. Correct.\n3 Q. Okay. And was it at this visit you\n4 were told about why the Mother was not given\n5 any custody, why custody was given to Father?\n6 Was it this visit? Or was it the\n7 December 19th visit?\n8 A. It was this visit.\n9 Q. Okay. And your understanding was\n10 what the Father informed you, correct?\n11 A. Correct.\n12 Q. Okay. Were you aware or informed by\n13 the Father or the Mother that an allegation\n14 of physical abuse was reported to DHR?\n15 Were you informed of that?\n16 A. Yes.\n17 Q. Okay. And were you informed that DHR\n18 investigated that allegation and determined\n19 that there was no abuse and gave a finding of\n20 not indicated?\n21 A. I was not.\n22 Q. Okay. Does that -- do you think\n23 that's important information when taken as a\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n47\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 whole in your treatment of the Child?\n2 A. Yes.\n3 Q. Okay. And I believe you said that --\n4 and correct me if I misstate -- I believe you\n5 said that the Father said that's why he was\n6 given custody was because of the physical\n7 abuse without provocation of the Mother,\n8 right?\n9 A. Correct.\n10 Q. Okay. Would you be surprised to know\n11 that this is not what the final court order\n12 states as to why custody determination was\n13 what it was?\n14 A. I -- I would say that's an important\n15 point. But surprised, I don't -- those are\n16 legal questions.\n17 Q. Sure. Would you be surprised to know\n18 that the Court actually gave the Mother\n19 regular and frequent visitation with the\n20 Child --\n21 A. Yes.\n22 Q. -- after all of these allegations\n23 came out?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n48\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Yes.\n2 Q. Okay. And then it was also -- since\n3 the Court was informed that these abuse\n4 allegations were not substantiated, it gave\n5 regular and routine visitation with the Child\n6 with Mother, right?\n7 A. If they did so, they did so, yes. I\n8 was not aware of that.\n9 Q. Okay. And were you informed -- and\n10 I'm sure you were -- were you informed that\n11 the final order came out around February, on\n12 February 27th, 2024?\n13 A. No, I was not aware of that.\n14 Q. Okay. And I'm going somewhere with\n15 this. So I know you're like why is she\n16 asking me these questions.\n17 Were you aware that -- let me make\n18 sure I say this correctly -- were you aware\n19 or informed of what the Mother's visitation\n20 schedule was at all in any way?\n21 A. On August the 1st, there was a\n22 mention of Mother picking her up from school,\n23 but there was no mention that the Court had\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n49\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 ordered something.\n2 Q. And when you say August the 1st, you\n3 mean August the 1st of 2025?\n4 A. Correct.\n5 Q. So I guess what I'm referencing is\n6 the visitation schedule that the Court\n7 awarded in the final decree of divorce on\n8 February 27th, 2024.\n9 MR. CLAYTON: I'm going to\n10 object.\n11 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n12 Q. Were you informed of any of that?\n13 MR. CLAYTON: I'm going to\n14 object to the form of these\n15 questions. I don't see any relation\n16 to what we're here for. But...\n17 MS. AGRICOLA: That's great.\n18 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n19 Q. So you weren't informed of the\n20 visitation schedule provided by the Court in\n21 February of 2024, were you?\n22 A. I was not.\n23 Q. Okay. And you weren't informed of\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n50\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that by Father, right?\n2 A. By anybody.\n3 Q. Okay. Were you aware that despite\n4 getting pretty significant visitation by the\n5 Court, that despite that, the Father\n6 prevented any visitation from being from\n7 being -- from occurring with Mother?\n8 Were you informed of that?\n9 A. I was not.\n10 Q. Okay. So even though the Court\n11 ordered the Father to do every other week\n12 with Mother and then split time in the\n13 summer, Blaine, the Father, did not inform\n14 you that he simply refused to do it?\n15 MR. CLAYTON: Again, I object\n16 to the form, especially as to\n17 relevancy.\n18 MS. AGRICOLA: Okay.\n19 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n20 Q. You can still answer.\n21 A. I was not aware.\n22 Q. Okay. Let's see. So were you aware\n23 that Father did not include Mother and her\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n51\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 contact information on any of the records\n2 with your -- with your facility?\n3 A. I was not aware.\n4 Q. Okay. But you were informed that\n5 there was a divorce, correct?\n6 A. I was.\n7 Q. Okay. And so I know you were\n8 often -- you're only subject to what the\n9 patient or the caregivers of the patient tell\n10 you.\n11 But when you deal with divorced\n12 parties, is there any sort of procedure that\n13 your facility does in order to ensure that\n14 you're in compliance with all requirements\n15 under the law for divorced parents?\n16 A. When someone presents a court decree,\n17 that is included in the chart. And those\n18 rules are followed.\n19 Q. Okay. Were you aware that Katie\n20 McGregor actually moved the Mother and her\n21 contact information from your office records\n22 so that she would not be contacted or\n23 informed?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n52\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. I was not aware.\n2 Q. Okay. Is that in your opinion --\n3 you're an owner of the business; is that\n4 correct?\n5 A. I am.\n6 Q. Okay. Learning that, is that a\n7 concern for you in terms of, you know,\n8 following applicable requirements under both\n9 the law as well as from the medical\n10 requirements?\n11 A. If --\n12 MR. CLAYTON: Again, object to\n13 the form.\n14 A. If it's substantiated.\n15 Q. Okay.\n16 A. But what you're giving me is hearsay.\n17 Q. Much like all the information you've\n18 been provided today by the Father, right?\n19 A. Correct.\n20 Q. Okay. Were you aware that the\n21 Court's final order required that the Mother\n22 be included and be a part of all of the\n23 appointment notifications of the Child?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n53\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Yes. In fact, she was invited to the\n2 first appointment in December and showed up\n3 30 minutes late.\n4 Q. So, actually, let me -- for the\n5 December 5th one, she was not informed. She\n6 was only informed for the December 19th one?\n7 A. The December 5th one, the Father\n8 showed me a text message where he had sent it\n9 to her and said don't forget, we have an\n10 appointment this morning. He showed it to me\n11 on his own cellphone.\n12 Q. Absolutely. And are you aware that\n13 people can change the names of contact\n14 information in their phone to make it appear\n15 that he had texted the Mother?\n16 A. I guess.\n17 Q. And were you aware that even in your\n18 phone you can change what the time is to make\n19 it look like something was sent or screen\n20 shot at a specific time?\n21 A. I guess, ma'am.\n22 Q. Okay. So the Father attended the\n23 December 5th appointment. And then you\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n54\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 said -- let me get back to this. It was at\n2 the December 5th appointment where your note\n3 states the information about the Mother,\n4 about her being 36 years old, her master's\n5 degree, et cetera, right?\n6 A. Correct.\n7 Q. And then it says current situation.\n8 It says got fired from the --\n9 A. Community college.\n10 Q. -- community college, uncertain\n11 circumstances, right?\n12 A. Correct. That was the information I\n13 was given.\n14 Q. Right. You were given by her\n15 ex-husband. Were you -- would it surprise\n16 you to know that that's false?\n17 MR. CLAYTON: I'm sorry. Would\n18 you repeat that?\n19 A. Would I be surprised if that were\n20 false?\n21 Q. Yeah. Would you be surprised to know\n22 that the information you were provided by\n23 Blaine about her employment with the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n55\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 community college, would you be surprised\n2 that information was false?\n3 MR. CLAYTON: I object to the\n4 form. If the witness can answer it,\n5 then answer it.\n6 A. You're -- I just can write down what\n7 the historian gives me, ma'am.\n8 Q. Correct. Which would be hearsay,\n9 right?\n10 MR. CLAYTON: That's asking for\n11 a legal conclusion that I'm not sure\n12 he can make. I object to the form of\n13 that.\n14 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n15 Q. You can answer. You've been asked\n16 multiple legal conclusions about custody from\n17 the other attorney.\n18 MR. CLAYTON: Object to the\n19 form.\n20 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n21 Q. So please answer. Would you be --\n22 and it's not a legal conclusion. Would you\n23 be surprised to know that was false?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n56\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Yes.\n2 Q. Okay.\n3 A. Maybe a better word would be -- would\n4 would -- that would be news I did not have.\n5 Yes, that would be information I did not\n6 have.\n7 Q. Okay. Dr. Tyler, do you anticipate\n8 testifying at the final trial on this case?\n9 A. I was hoping this deposition would\n10 suffice. My understanding is that was the\n11 purpose of this.\n12 Q. It could if it had been done\n13 procedurally correctly, but it has not. So\n14 I'm guessing your answer to that is then you\n15 have not anticipated testifying at trial?\n16 A. That is correct.\n17 Q. Okay. So you did what's called a\n18 SCARD test. Did you -- do you utilize that\n19 score or the results of that testing to then\n20 make the medical decision to place the Child\n21 on anxiety medication?\n22 A. Correct.\n23 Q. Okay. Have you had other visits with\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n57\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 the Child prior to the December 5th visit?\n2 A. I can recall seeing her only once or\n3 twice. Because the majority of her care was\n4 provided for by Dr. Tauro in Kellyton.\n5 Q. Okay. Did you have any communication\n6 with Dr. Tauro regarding her history or\n7 discussions with him about any mental health\n8 issues?\n9 A. I did not.\n10 Q. Okay. I'm going to -- is this SCARD\n11 test, can you tell me a little bit about that\n12 test? I'm not familiar at all. It's a\n13 standardized test?\n14 A. It is a standardized test.\n15 Q. And how long does it take?\n16 A. It's 37 questions in length. It's\n17 filled out by a parent.\n18 Q. The test is filled out by a parent?\n19 A. There's two versions of it. So\n20 there's a version that can be filled out by a\n21 parent, and there's a version that can be\n22 filled out by a child. This one I think was\n23 filled out by the patient.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n58\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Are you looking at it in front of\n2 you?\n3 A. I am looking at the test. This one\n4 was filled out by the patient.\n5 Q. Okay. And was it filled out -- when\n6 it was filled out, was the Father present in\n7 the room and were you present in the room as\n8 well?\n9 A. I was not present in the room.\n10 Usually the patients are given privacy to\n11 complete these questions.\n12 Q. Okay. Was her father in the room\n13 with her?\n14 A. He was.\n15 Q. Okay. So then you don't really know\n16 if the Father had any sort of input into the\n17 responses to the questions?\n18 A. I was in there when some of the\n19 questions were answered by her, and he had no\n20 input on those.\n21 Q. Which questions were you in the room\n22 with him?\n23 A. I can't answer that question, ma'am.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n59\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 I do not know.\n2 Q. Okay. So I guess it is -- is it your\n3 testimony that for some of the 37 questions\n4 she was alone with her father in the room,\n5 and then you came back into the room before\n6 she had completed it?\n7 Is that what you're saying?\n8 A. That is correct.\n9 Q. Okay. So then would it be safe to\n10 say that it would probably be -- the\n11 questions that you were in the room for were\n12 towards the end?\n13 A. I do not recall.\n14 Q. Okay. How long did you give her\n15 privacy with her father to fill out the first\n16 37?\n17 A. Until it was completed.\n18 Q. I'm sorry. Let me rephrase. Was it\n19 approximately 15 minutes before you came back\n20 in the room? Or 30 minutes? Or --\n21 A. I would say between 10 and 15.\n22 Q. Okay. And then after 10 to 15\n23 minutes, you came back into the room, and she\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n60\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 had not finished the remaining questions, and\n2 so you --\n3 A. No. She had -- no. She had\n4 completed all of them.\n5 Q. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I thought\n6 you -- I must have misunderstood you then.\n7 A. I was there for her initiation of the\n8 test.\n9 Q. Okay.\n10 A. Not the termination of the test.\n11 Q. Okay. I see. So then she began\n12 filling out the test with you present, and at\n13 some point before she completed it, you left\n14 the room for 10 or 15 minutes?\n15 A. Until she completed it. I can't tell\n16 you how long it was, ma'am. I don't know.\n17 Q. Okay. Okay. Let's -- and after\n18 that, the results of that test is when you\n19 decided to place her on the medication,\n20 correct?\n21 A. On the serotoninergic medication,\n22 Lexapro, yes, because of this standardized\n23 testing.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n61\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. And let me just ask you. Where --\n2 I'm looking at your notes. Where does it --\n3 is that at the end where it says assessment,\n4 is that where it says the medicine she was\n5 placed on after that? I think I saw it.\n6 Medication. Encounter disposition and then\n7 it says medication.\n8 A. Look under plan.\n9 Q. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Inderal on\n10 testing days. Jornay? Is that correct? Am\n11 I pronouncing that?\n12 A. Well, she was placed on\n13 methylphenidate Metadate CD at that visit.\n14 If you look at another place, the\n15 Metadate CD 10-milligram tablet, it was\n16 started on that one to start on the lowest\n17 possible dose of the medication.\n18 That's under medications. The\n19 Metadate CD was the one that was actually\n20 filled.\n21 Q. The one that was actually what?\n22 A. Filled by the pharmacy.\n23 Q. Filled. Okay. I see. Okay. Okay.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n62\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 I'm going to move to the next note from\n2 December 19, 2024, those notes. If you'll\n3 grab those.\n4 In the CC/HPI, you said the patient\n5 has the following diagnoses, ADHD and anxiety\n6 and then a history of physical abuse at the\n7 hands of Mother.\n8 Right?\n9 A. Correct.\n10 Q. So are you able to diagnose a history\n11 of physical abuse at the hands of Mother?\n12 A. A history is a history. It's not a\n13 diagnosis.\n14 Q. Okay. You said correct, so I thought\n15 that was your diagnosis. Okay.\n16 A. No, ma'am. It's not really a\n17 diagnosis.\n18 Q. Right. Okay. So then the diagnosis\n19 was ADHD and anxiety, correct?\n20 A. Correct.\n21 Q. Okay. So what testing did you do to\n22 determine that she should be diagnosed with\n23 ADHD?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n63\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Vanderbilt Rating Scores that were\n2 performed prior to that December 5th visit.\n3 Q. Okay. And what date was the\n4 Vanderbilt Rating Scales Test performed?\n5 A. I believe it's October the 2nd of\n6 2024.\n7 Q. October 2nd, 2024?\n8 A. Correct.\n9 Q. Tell me about the Vanderbilt testing.\n10 A. Vanderbilt testing. There's several\n11 different scales for ADHD. Vanderbilt's are\n12 but one of those. These are the easiest ones\n13 to use.\n14 These work fairly well for people\n15 that have combined ADHD. They're notoriously\n16 not so valid for people that have\n17 predominantly inattentive ADHD. That is\n18 called the silent morbidity.\n19 A lot of females with ADHD have\n20 inattentive ADHD, and they do not have\n21 significant findings on score -- on scales\n22 like this.\n23 Q. Okay. Okay. And you didn't perform\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n64\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that test though, did you? That was\n2 performed by the other --\n3 A. Those are performed by observers in\n4 two different settings.\n5 Q. Okay.\n6 A. Not by a physician.\n7 Q. I see. Okay. In the notes that you\n8 have, you documented Mother and Father\n9 divorced. Father has primary decision\n10 making, custodial control at present.\n11 Right?\n12 A. Correct.\n13 Q. You documented that? Okay. And that\n14 was informed -- you were told that by Father,\n15 correct?\n16 A. Correct.\n17 Q. And were you aware that per the\n18 divorce order in February of '24 that the\n19 parties were given joint legal custody of the\n20 Child?\n21 A. February 24 of 2024? Or February 24\n22 of 2025?\n23 Q. February of 2024.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n65\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. I was not made aware of that.\n2 Q. Okay. So with joint legal custody,\n3 are you aware of what that means in the\n4 context of how it's relevant to you as a\n5 physician?\n6 A. Yes.\n7 Q. Okay. And explain to me your\n8 understanding of that.\n9 A. My understanding is when there is\n10 joint custody there's usually a primary\n11 decision-making custodian. That's almost\n12 always been the case, and it's the person\n13 that they reside with.\n14 Now, how they work out joint\n15 decision making beyond that is\n16 individualized. Different people do that\n17 different ways. Sometimes they have an\n18 amiable relationships, and they both discuss\n19 things. And sometimes it's not, and the\n20 primary custodial guardian makes the\n21 decisions.\n22 Q. Okay. Were you aware that the\n23 divorce order which determined custody in\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n66\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 February of 2024, were you aware that it\n2 specifically laid out that both parents would\n3 have the right to make appointments, consult\n4 and counsel with educational or medical\n5 professionals regarding the Children?\n6 Each party shall have the right to\n7 participate in school conferences, events,\n8 activities, school personnel, medical and\n9 healthcare providers, psychologists and other\n10 counselors who are working with the Minor\n11 Children.\n12 Were you aware that the divorce\n13 order in February of 2024 specifically\n14 included that language?\n15 A. I was not.\n16 Q. Okay. Were you aware that the order\n17 stated that each party shall be listed as an\n18 emergency contact for all schools and medical\n19 providers?\n20 Were you aware of that?\n21 A. I was I was not.\n22 Q. To your knowledge, was Brittany\n23 Gilliland listed as a contact in any manner\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n67\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 for the Child in November of 2024?\n2 A. I do not know the answer to your\n3 question.\n4 Q. Okay. What about, was Brittany\n5 Gilliland listed as the Mother at any point\n6 in time in December of 2024 with your\n7 facility?\n8 A. As the Mother? She was listed as the\n9 Mother, yes, ma'am.\n10 Q. As a contact?\n11 A. I do not know the specifics of that.\n12 Q. Okay. So then as it stands here\n13 today, September 10th, 2025, is the Mother\n14 listed as a contact on this Child's records\n15 with your facility?\n16 A. I do not know the answer to your\n17 question.\n18 Q. Okay. Since I've read out the final\n19 order from the Court as to joint legal\n20 custody for both parties, do you believe that\n21 the Mother should be listed as a contact?\n22 MR. CLAYTON: Object to the\n23 form. That's asking for a conclusion\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n68\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 this witness is not capable of\n2 giving.\n3 MS. AGRICOLA: You asked about\n4 who should have custody. So I think\n5 we've kind of moved past that.\n6 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n7 Q. But you can still answer that.\n8 A. If I have a judge's order, we will\n9 follow the judge's decree.\n10 Q. At any point in time, did Blaine\n11 McGregor provide you with the Judge's order\n12 which required all of these things?\n13 A. I'm not aware of that.\n14 Q. Okay. Were you aware that Katie\n15 McGregor was aware of these things?\n16 A. Not aware of that.\n17 Q. And you're also not aware that Katie\n18 McGregor removed Brittany Gilliland as a\n19 contact for this patient, right?\n20 You're not aware of that?\n21 A. I'm not aware of that.\n22 Q. Okay. If you're provided with a DHR\n23 letter that shows that the Mother was\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n69\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 investigated for the child abuse and found\n2 that it was not substantiated, would that\n3 result in you editing your records to be\n4 accurate for what occurred?\n5 A. Ma'am, I think as a lawyer you know\n6 doctors when they sign records are not\n7 supposed to reopen those. I mean, that was\n8 the record at the time. That's the best\n9 information I had.\n10 Are you requesting that I go back\n11 and edit all these?\n12 Q. Well, what I'm trying to point out to\n13 you is that your records as-is, through no\n14 fault of your own, are inaccurate because you\n15 were provided false information by Blaine\n16 McGregor.\n17 So what is the protocol when that\n18 is brought to your attention?\n19 A. I would have to consult my medical\n20 malpractice legal team to find out. I don't\n21 know the answer to that.\n22 Q. Okay. Was the information about the\n23 Mother physically abusing the child, I\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n70\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 imagine that factored in substantially to a\n2 lot of how you treated the Child?\n3 A. It was a -- it's a noteworthy piece\n4 of information as you're making a decision if\n5 it's true, yes.\n6 Q. Okay. And let me ask you this. You\n7 testified earlier that the Mother was\n8 informed of the December 5th, 2024 visit.\n9 But that was only from what the Father\n10 informed you; is that correct?\n11 A. That's correct.\n12 Q. Okay. So there's no one in your\n13 office or you're not testifying today that\n14 someone -- that you or someone that was\n15 employed by your office notified the Mother\n16 of the December 5th, 2024 appointment, are\n17 you?\n18 A. Ma'am, I -- I -- not many physicians\n19 know who calls people and makes appointments\n20 for the patients to be seen. So I would say\n21 that that information is rarely available to\n22 any physician.\n23 I don't -- I don't know who -- I\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n71\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 know who the people in my office that manage\n2 school problems, and that's one group of\n3 people. But who all they notify, I can't\n4 tell you. I don't know that.\n5 Q. Right. I guess I'm just trying to\n6 get a confirmation that no one in your office\n7 called Ms. Gilliland or sent her an e-mail\n8 and said, hey, there's a December 5th, 2024\n9 appointment?\n10 A. I -- I can't -- can't answer that\n11 question. I don't know. That might have\n12 happened, ma'am. You're asking me -- I'm\n13 telling you I don't know the answer to your\n14 question.\n15 Q. Okay. Well, let me ask you this.\n16 Does your -- I know some of my doctors\n17 whenever I make an appointment, they'll do an\n18 automatic text that says the appointment time\n19 and date.\n20 Do you have any sort of software or\n21 is there something like that that happens in\n22 your office?\n23 A. We do.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n72\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. And does that -- so when an\n2 appointment is made, does it send out like a\n3 text or an e-mail to the person who makes the\n4 appointment?\n5 A. It does.\n6 Q. And for this particular patient, this\n7 Child, is that contact in the file the\n8 Father?\n9 A. That's a --\n10 Q. You don't know?\n11 A. I don't know, ma'am. That's a\n12 different system. We have two systems that\n13 work together. That is a system called\n14 Phreesia. That's not our operating system\n15 for our office.\n16 Q. Okay. Why don't you tell me about\n17 your operating system for your office in\n18 regards to appointments and scheduling\n19 information?\n20 A. At present, it's a system called\n21 Phreesia. It's being used by many doctors\n22 offices. And when an appointment is made,\n23 there's a notification sent out through\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n73\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Phreesia.\n2 We're in the process of trying to\n3 morph that to our office practicum electronic\n4 health record. That is a work in progress\n5 right now. But at the time of this, it was\n6 all Phreesia.\n7 Q. Okay. And you previously answered\n8 that you don't know if the Mother was ever\n9 listed as a contact related to this patient\n10 to receive information?\n11 A. I do not know the answer to your\n12 question.\n13 Q. Okay. And do you know anything\n14 about the events that occurred at the\n15 Kellyton office for the November of 2024\n16 appointment with this Child?\n17 A. I am not aware of any of the details\n18 of that which you allude to.\n19 Q. Okay. So what you did notate is that\n20 Mother was invited to the first evaluation.\n21 Are you referencing the December\n22 5th?\n23 A. I am.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n74\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. And, again, she wasn't\n2 notified or invited by your office, correct?\n3 A. Well, ma'am, I'm not sure who invited\n4 her. She just showed up 30 minutes late to\n5 that first evaluation. So she knew about it.\n6 Q. I'm sorry. I'm looking at the 12/19\n7 visit. That's where it says she showed up\n8 30 minutes late.\n9 A. She showed up 30 minutes late for the\n10 first one as well. She showed up more like\n11 15 minutes late for the second one.\n12 Q. Okay. And you're not aware of any\n13 communications where the Father told her the\n14 wrong appointment time, are you?\n15 A. I do not know that, ma'am.\n16 Q. Okay. Would you be surprised to know\n17 that he did inform her of a different\n18 appointment time than what the actual\n19 appointment time was?\n20 A. I -- I don't know how to answer that\n21 question, ma'am. I'm sorry.\n22 Q. Okay. You notate in the December\n23 19th visit that Father and daughter were in\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n75\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 the room without Mother for the first 10\n2 minutes of the interview.\n3 A. Correct.\n4 Q. Why did you -- why is that\n5 noteworthy?\n6 A. Because Mother wasn't there.\n7 Q. So do you normally notate that in\n8 your visit notes?\n9 A. Only when I feel like it might be a\n10 factor.\n11 Q. Okay. Would it be a factor if the\n12 Mother was told a different time by the\n13 Father? Would that be a factor?\n14 A. I guess. I just know that --\n15 Q. Okay.\n16 A. -- the appointment started at \"X\"\n17 time. The Mom showed up 10 minutes into the\n18 appointment.\n19 Q. Okay. You notate that Mother came to\n20 the room. And you state the question of\n21 current status was posed. A plea was made to\n22 keep this conversation all about helping the\n23 Child and not about conflict they have in\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n76\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 their life.\n2 Who posed the question and who made\n3 the plea to keep the conversation about --\n4 A. Me.\n5 Q. Oh, you did. I see. Okay.\n6 A. I was trying to make this all about\n7 the Child.\n8 Q. Understandable. And when you\n9 reference the conflict they had with their\n10 life, what did you mean by that? What were\n11 you referencing?\n12 A. Obviously, they were not in an\n13 amiable position.\n14 Q. Sure. Were you aware that there was\n15 ongoing -- there was ongoing litigation at\n16 the time?\n17 A. I just know in situations like this\n18 unfortunately children wind up being the rope\n19 in a tug-of-war.\n20 Q. Right.\n21 A. I detest that.\n22 Q. Right. Were you aware that there had\n23 been -- that at the time of these\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n77\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 appointments that Mother had filed an action\n2 to get the visitation that she was already\n3 ordered because the Father had been refusing\n4 it?\n5 A. I was not aware of that.\n6 Q. So Blaine, the Father, did not tell\n7 you that he's refused all visitation with the\n8 Mother?\n9 A. He did not.\n10 Q. Okay. And Blaine, of course, did not\n11 inform you that the DHR investigation\n12 believed -- that investigated the abuse\n13 allegations and it came out as not indicated,\n14 meaning unsubstantiated?\n15 He did not inform of you that?\n16 A. I was not made aware of that.\n17 Q. In fact, he told you the opposite.\n18 He lied and told you that was the basis for\n19 him being awarded primary physical custody.\n20 Right?\n21 A. I'm sorry. I had a hard time\n22 understanding what you said there.\n23 Q. I said: In fact, he told you the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n78\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 opposite. He lied to you and told you that\n2 the abuse was the basis of him being warded\n3 primary physical custody.\n4 A. That was my initial understanding,\n5 yes.\n6 Q. Okay. And your understanding came\n7 solely from Blaine, correct?\n8 A. Correct.\n9 Q. Okay. When the Mother requested the\n10 Child be excused from the room, what was\n11 your -- I couldn't remember -- did you excuse\n12 the Child? Or what was your reaction to\n13 that?\n14 A. The Child was excused immediately.\n15 Q. Okay. And is that when she engaged\n16 in the discussion about not understanding why\n17 the Child was being treated with the\n18 medication?\n19 A. Correct.\n20 Q. Okay. Now, you notate that Mom tried\n21 to state that the prescription -- or the\n22 anxiety began when Father assumed full\n23 custody.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n79\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Did you -- did that factor in at\n2 all for you?\n3 A. Well, when we go back and, you know,\n4 you look at the original history, these\n5 symptoms of anxiety and ADHD actually started\n6 in the third grade. It was long before\n7 Father was given custody.\n8 And when that was brought up to the\n9 Mother, she concurred. These problems had\n10 been going on that long.\n11 Q. Right. The ADHD. But did it factor\n12 in that the Mother had stated that the\n13 anxiety all came into play after he got full\n14 custody?\n15 A. Well, she acknowledged that the\n16 anxiety and ADHD were both there prior to\n17 that --\n18 Q. Okay.\n19 A. -- starting in the third grade.\n20 Q. Okay. You also notate that the\n21 patient had said the meds were beneficial,\n22 and that Father's observations confirmed that\n23 as well. You say that teachers confirmed the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n80\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 progress.\n2 Did you speak to her teachers?\n3 A. I did not. But that was the report I\n4 got from the patient as well as the Father.\n5 Q. Okay. So, again, all of the\n6 information, a lot or most of the information\n7 that you're receiving is just from the\n8 Father, hearsay from the Father?\n9 A. And the patient.\n10 Q. And the patient?\n11 A. Right.\n12 Q. Right. Okay. Now, the Mother\n13 claimed those were not her observations. And\n14 did that factor in for you?\n15 A. Well, when the Father questioned how\n16 she had been able to make those observations,\n17 the discussion escalated from there.\n18 Q. Okay. In fact, the Mom said that the\n19 Child should be under the care of a\n20 psychiatrist. Do you disagree with that?\n21 A. If that's -- that's every parent's\n22 prerogative, ma'am. That's certainly an\n23 option.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n81\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay.\n2 A. It's just not available to most\n3 people who live in rural Alabama.\n4 Q. Okay. And the Mother made the\n5 allegation that the Father was seeking the\n6 meds so he could sell those medications.\n7 Did that -- was that not a concern\n8 for you? I mean, it's more hearsay\n9 statements that you're receiving.\n10 A. The situation, it looked like\n11 somebody was trying to throw a hand grenade\n12 at another human being.\n13 Q. Okay. Are you aware that we -- that\n14 there were test messages which document the\n15 Father selling ADHD medication?\n16 A. I am not aware of that.\n17 Q. Would that then make you believe the\n18 hearsay statements of Mother versus Father?\n19 A. I would -- I would have to tell you\n20 that's a -- that's a Class II felony.\n21 Q. It is.\n22 A. I'm not aware of any information like\n23 that.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n82\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. So I guess what I'm wondering\n2 is -- and I certainly get that you've been\n3 provided information from one side, the\n4 Father.\n5 But when the Mother was present and\n6 is throwing out information that's\n7 concerning, is it possible that you had made\n8 a judgment about the situation based on the\n9 Father's statements to you before and you\n10 didn't believe anything that --\n11 A. At this point, my judgment on the\n12 situation was how the patient felt the drug,\n13 the medications, had impacted her life in a\n14 favorable manner.\n15 Q. Okay.\n16 A. That was the most important thing to\n17 me was the impact of these interventions on\n18 the patient's life and her ability to find\n19 success.\n20 Q. Okay. You say at one point you\n21 instructed the Mother to leave or she would\n22 be escorted out by law enforcement.\n23 A. It escalated.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n83\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. And did it escalate -- tell\n2 me, describe how it escalated.\n3 A. She became agitated. She had a\n4 threatening stance. Her voice became louder\n5 and sharper. And it was going to get out of\n6 control.\n7 Q. Okay. When you say she had a\n8 threatening stance, she's like five-two.\n9 Tell me how she -- what stance. Tell me\n10 about the stance you're saying was\n11 threatening. I think she might even be\n12 five-one.\n13 She's quite a petite young lady,\n14 wouldn't you say?\n15 A. I would agree with her stature. But,\n16 ma'am, even small women can give off an aura\n17 that they're very upset.\n18 Q. Sure. And I don't disagree that\n19 she -- I mean, I don't dispute with you that\n20 she may have been upset.\n21 I guess I'm just -- when you said\n22 that you asked her to leave or you would call\n23 law enforcement, I'm asking what behavior was\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n84\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 exhibited by, you know, a five-foot tall\n2 individual that made you feel the need to\n3 call law enforcement.\n4 Are you smaller? Are you shorter\n5 than that? Obviously, I'm seeing you on\n6 Zoom. I can't tell if you're six feet tall\n7 or, you know, three feet tall.\n8 A. I'm four foot one. Ma'am, in\n9 situations like this, no one ever knows when\n10 there's lots of emotions where they're going.\n11 Q. Right.\n12 A. And I have a responsibility to keep\n13 my staff and the other patients in my office\n14 safe.\n15 Q. Of course.\n16 A. And I have to make sure that when I\n17 see something that's getting out of control\n18 that I try to manage it in a way that no one\n19 else in the office is going to be harmed.\n20 And that was my feeling. That I\n21 needed to stop the discussion in order to\n22 deescalate the situation.\n23 Q. Sure.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n85\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. And that's not hearsay.\n2 Q. Oh, I understand. I guess my\n3 question was: Did Blaine engage in any of\n4 the conflict as well?\n5 A. He did not.\n6 Q. Okay. Did the Mother threaten to\n7 cause any violence?\n8 A. Well, she was peppering allegation\n9 after allegation after allegation. And not\n10 all of those were written down in here.\n11 That the only reason he wanted to\n12 get the drugs was to sell them was sort of\n13 the final straw. And at which point, he\n14 really took offense to that.\n15 Q. Sure.\n16 A. And it looked like he was going to\n17 respond to that. And that's when I said this\n18 has -- this has got to stop. Because, again,\n19 I prefaced all of this, this has got to be\n20 about the Child.\n21 Q. Of course.\n22 A. And it turned a different direction.\n23 And that was the -- that was the boundaries\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n86\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that I placed around that discussion. It's\n2 got to be about the Child.\n3 Q. Right. Okay. But I believe what you\n4 just said is when she started making an\n5 allegation about him trying to sell the ADHD\n6 medication he was offended and he was about\n7 to respond.\n8 And so that's when you kind of\n9 ended the -- terminated the conversation?\n10 A. The whole -- the whole interview was\n11 ended at that time. Because both sides were\n12 getting more animated.\n13 Q. Okay.\n14 A. It was both. It wasn't -- it wasn't\n15 just him responding. It was her as well.\n16 Q. Okay. But both parents were getting\n17 heated?\n18 A. That's correct.\n19 Q. So you're not stating and your notes\n20 don't indicate that she made any threats of\n21 physical violence or anything like that,\n22 right?\n23 A. No. Because I did not want it to get\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n87\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 to that point.\n2 Q. Okay. So when you say terminated it\n3 to prevent conflict, you meant conflict\n4 between the parties?\n5 A. Correct.\n6 Q. I see. Okay. You also said that she\n7 had her cellphone out during the interview\n8 and that if she recorded it it was not\n9 disclosed and permission was not granted.\n10 A. That is correct.\n11 Q. Are you aware of the law on recording\n12 conversations in the State of Alabama?\n13 A. In my office, we do not. It's our\n14 office policy. We request people do not\n15 record anything that goes on in our rooms.\n16 Many doctors have that as a rule.\n17 Q. Okay. So then you're saying that's\n18 your office policy?\n19 A. That is correct.\n20 Q. Okay. But you're not alleging that\n21 it's a violation of the law because she\n22 didn't get your permission, correct?\n23 A. That would be -- well, I thought that\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n88\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 in Alabama permission had to be granted to\n2 record conversations.\n3 Q. No. In Alabama as well as Georgia\n4 are one-party states. So as long as one\n5 party of the conversation is aware that it is\n6 being recording, then no other individual --\n7 MR. CLAYTON: I'm going to\n8 object to the form of this line of\n9 questioning. I don't know what the\n10 law about recording has to do with\n11 the care of this Child. I guess\n12 that's relevancy.\n13 MS. AGRICOLA: Okay.\n14 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n15 Q. So you can answer. Are you aware\n16 that Alabama and Georgia are only one-party\n17 states where only one person who is a party\n18 of the conversation needs to be informed of\n19 the recording?\n20 A. I am not aware of that.\n21 Q. Okay. So then she was not in\n22 violation of any law if she was recording\n23 you? And I'm not saying that she was.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n89\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Ma'am, I'm stating the mere fact that\n2 if she was recording us she did not\n3 acknowledge that I'm recording this\n4 conversation and you need to be aware. That\n5 did not happen. There's no -- there's no\n6 substance in here about breaking a law.\n7 Q. Sure. I'm just clarifying that.\n8 A. All right. And I'm clarifying my\n9 part of it too.\n10 Q. Okay. Let me look at the January\n11 9th, 2025 note. This visit was only with the\n12 Father and the Child; is that correct?\n13 A. That's correct.\n14 Q. Okay. And you don't have any\n15 information that Mother was informed of the\n16 visit, do you?\n17 A. I do not know the answer to that\n18 question.\n19 Q. Okay. And she was not informed by\n20 anyone in your office, correct?\n21 A. I cannot answer that question. I do\n22 not know.\n23 Q. Okay. You noted the teachers have\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n90\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 noted an improvement in school. You did not\n2 contact any of her teachers to get this\n3 confirmation, correct?\n4 A. I did not.\n5 Q. Okay. So this information is just\n6 hearsay information provided by the Father\n7 and the patient?\n8 A. Correct.\n9 Q. Okay. Is there a way that you would\n10 be able to look in your, I think you called\n11 it Phreesia? I think you said there's two\n12 different systems that your office utilizes,\n13 right?\n14 A. Correct.\n15 Q. Is there a way that you could look\n16 into in your system to determine if Mother\n17 had been added as a contact for the patient?\n18 A. That can be done.\n19 Q. Okay. Is there a way through your\n20 system that it can determine when Mother was\n21 added as a contact?\n22 A. I do not know the answer to that\n23 technical question. I do not know.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n91\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. Is there a way in your system\n2 that you can determine any additions or\n3 deletions of contacts?\n4 A. I -- I don't know, ma'am. That's not\n5 the part of the system that I work with.\n6 Q. Okay. Is there a way for you to be\n7 able -- I'm getting that you probably like\n8 myself don't handle a lot of some of the\n9 procedural day-to-day aspects. Your staff\n10 handles that.\n11 Would that be a fair assessment?\n12 A. That's why they're there, yes.\n13 Q. Right. So is there a way that you\n14 can look into the issue of whether or not\n15 Mother was ever at any point added as a\n16 contact, or is currently today, by\n17 communicating with your staff?\n18 A. I can try. But I -- I -- the current\n19 status is certainly easily obtainable. But\n20 going back and answering questions about when\n21 and who, I don't know that.\n22 I can't even open Phreesia. I\n23 don't -- I know how to spell it, but I can't\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n92\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 open it. I don't know.\n2 Q. I understand. Let me ask you this.\n3 Was the information that -- or what I've\n4 alleged to you today that Katie McGregor\n5 removed Mother as a contact at some point, is\n6 that something that you're going to go and\n7 look into to determine the truthfulness of\n8 that?\n9 A. Affirmative.\n10 Q. Okay. And if there's not a way to\n11 determine whether that occurred, is there --\n12 I guess is there something that you're going\n13 to go forward to ensure that Katie McGregor\n14 has no ability to be involved or have access\n15 to any of the records related to this Child?\n16 A. That can be done. And she's been\n17 given very, very strict rules since December\n18 to not open the chart, to not have anything\n19 to do with the chart. That's already taken\n20 place.\n21 Q. Okay. But when you say she's been\n22 given very strict rules to not look in the\n23 chart or open the chart, are we talking about\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n93\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 like a physical chart? Or are we talking\n2 about like on a computer?\n3 A. Electronic health record. We don't\n4 have paper charts.\n5 Q. Okay. So then is there a way -- I\n6 mean, could she easily sign in under someone\n7 else's log-in info?\n8 A. No, she cannot. That is a HIPAA\n9 violation.\n10 Q. Okay. Well, I know it's a HIPAA\n11 violation.\n12 A. It's a HIPAA violation if she signs\n13 in using somebody else's password. That's\n14 not allowed.\n15 Q. Well, I understand that. I just --\n16 it certainly is a possibility that she could\n17 go in and do that if she had someone else's\n18 log-in information, correct?\n19 A. Well, yes, ma'am, I guess that's\n20 possible if she had somebody else's log-in\n21 information.\n22 Q. Okay.\n23 A. Is that your -- is that your\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n94\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 allegation that I have an employee that's got\n2 another --\n3 Q. No. My allegation is that she did\n4 all -- she removed the Mother as a contact\n5 prior to December of 2024, so that she could\n6 not be with the --\n7 A. I've got that. And I'm going to\n8 investigate that. But I -- I will tell you\n9 that our employees do not have shared\n10 passwords. They're not -- that is -- that's\n11 a significant breach.\n12 Q. Right.\n13 A. And she -- if she has that ability,\n14 that -- that is going to be very serious\n15 problem.\n16 Q. Okay. On the first page of this\n17 January 9th, 2025 note, at the bottom under\n18 the patient history, it says child abuse\n19 confirmed, subsequent encounter.\n20 A. With the information you've given me\n21 today, that probably needs to be rephrased.\n22 Q. Would you like us to send you the DHR\n23 letter that demonstrates that she was -- that\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n95\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 that allegation was investigated and it was\n2 unsubstantiated?\n3 A. That would be very helpful.\n4 Q. Give me one second. And would it\n5 surprise you to know that that letter, the\n6 DHR letter that is the result of the\n7 investigation by DHR into the child abuse, it\n8 was dated January of 2024?\n9 A. You're telling me information I don't\n10 have.\n11 Q. Okay. So, of course, these notes\n12 from -- beginning in December are, you know,\n13 11 months later after it's already been --\n14 after it's already been confirmed.\n15 Let me ask you this. I asked you a\n16 little bit about parental alienation earlier.\n17 Are you -- do you have any experience with --\n18 from a medical perspective of parents\n19 coaching their children to say various things\n20 in a medical setting?\n21 A. Sure, that happens.\n22 Q. Okay. Have you ever -- have you ever\n23 had that or been suspicious of that in any\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n96\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 past patients?\n2 And, of course, I don't want to\n3 know any information. But do you have any\n4 experience from that firsthand?\n5 Or just what's your experience? Or\n6 was it training?\n7 A. Yes. Probably the prototype of that\n8 is -- this is an old term, but it's\n9 Munchausen's by proxy. That's the term we\n10 used to use for that when parents claim\n11 children have illnesses, and then it can be\n12 very difficult to prove -- prove that.\n13 Q. Sure.\n14 A. But, yes, I'm aware of that, ma'am.\n15 Q. Okay. And are you familiar with\n16 coaching in respect to, for example, a child,\n17 a patient, giving a history of physical abuse\n18 of another parent in a divorced parent\n19 setting?\n20 Are you familiar with any\n21 parental -- on that? Do you have any\n22 training related to that?\n23 A. I do not have training. I'm sure it\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n97\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 could happen.\n2 Q. Okay. Given your -- your reactions\n3 and your responses to your testimony today\n4 indicate that there are some things that\n5 you've been surprised to learn in this\n6 deposition.\n7 Is that a fair statement?\n8 A. Yes.\n9 Q. Okay. And, previously, when you were\n10 asked about do you have an opinion on the\n11 custody and, you know, where the Child should\n12 be, I believe you testified that -- let me\n13 make sure I say it correctly. I want to say\n14 what you said -- I believe you said you think\n15 the Child is in the safest environment in the\n16 care of the Father.\n17 Is that correct?\n18 A. She's thriving in that environment at\n19 present.\n20 Q. Okay. You haven't witnessed her in\n21 any other environment though, have you?\n22 A. I have not.\n23 Q. Okay. And you have not witnessed her\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n98\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 in an environment where the court order was\n2 followed and her Mother had visitation as\n3 ordered by the Court?\n4 You haven't witnessed that either,\n5 have you?\n6 A. I have not.\n7 Q. Okay. So all of your opinion is\n8 based solely on the hearsay information\n9 provided by the Father and the patient which\n10 may or may not be correct?\n11 MR. CLAYTON: Object to the\n12 form of that. That has nothing to do\n13 with his diagnosis.\n14 BY MS. AGRICOLA:\n15 Q. Okay. You can answer that.\n16 A. Can you repeat the question so I can\n17 answer?\n18 Q. Yes. Your opinion as to --\n19 specifically, the opinion you gave earlier\n20 where you stated, quote, you think the Child\n21 is in the safest environment with the Father,\n22 end quote, that opinion is based solely on\n23 the hearsay statements provided by the Father\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n99\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 and the Child.\n2 Correct?\n3 A. And the Child, yes.\n4 Q. Okay. And you have no other basis\n5 other than that, correct?\n6 A. Correct.\n7 Q. Okay. Now that you have been\n8 informed of the DHR letter which determined\n9 that the abuse did not occur, does that\n10 change any view that you have related to the\n11 accuracy of all of the information provided\n12 to you by the Father and the patient?\n13 A. I think I'd like to focus on the\n14 current status of the Child, and that goes\n15 back to the August 1st visit. This is a\n16 Child who had significant anxiety. She had\n17 poor grades.\n18 In December, she got started on the\n19 medication. She finished the school year\n20 with AB Honor Roll. She's able to leave her\n21 home to go off as a seventh grader to a cheer\n22 camp. She excelled. She excelled.\n23 And the observations of the people\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n100\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 around her was that she was quite good at\n2 what she did resulting in her selection as\n3 basically a camp all star. And she did so\n4 well with her team that she was chosen to be\n5 the head of team.\n6 My -- my focus from the beginning\n7 has been how can we help this young lady meet\n8 her potential. And what I can say is at this\n9 point that's -- that's a long distance to\n10 come based on where she was in December. And\n11 that she is in -- she's really thriving at\n12 this point in time.\n13 Q. And were you aware that she has been\n14 involved in cheerleading for several years?\n15 A. But she had not gone away from home\n16 to participate in camp. That's a\n17 different --\n18 Q. Are you sure about that?\n19 A. A week-long camp where you spend -- a\n20 three-or-four-night camp where you spend the\n21 night? I'm not aware that she had been there\n22 before.\n23 Most girls before they get to the\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n101\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 middle school don't have access to that.\n2 It's day camps.\n3 Q. So then you're saying your conclusion\n4 that she's thriving is because she's done so\n5 well and she's back with cheerleading and she\n6 was selected as an all star and she went to a\n7 week-long camp?\n8 A. And she -- she thrived being on her\n9 own by herself.\n10 Q. Right.\n11 A. And --\n12 Q. You aren't aware that she's actually\n13 gone to overnight camps in the previous\n14 years? She's been to cheer camp every year?\n15 A. I wasn't aware of that.\n16 Q. So then your basis for her having\n17 such substantial improvement going to a\n18 week-long camp isn't really accurate then\n19 because she's done that every year, right?\n20 A. The sense -- the sense I got from her\n21 in December when I saw her is that she\n22 wouldn't be able to do something like that.\n23 Q. Okay. You said that's the sense you\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n102\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 got. Did you ask her if she had --\n2 A. I did not.\n3 Q. -- gone to previous cheer camps?\n4 A. I did not.\n5 Q. Okay. So knowing that she had gone\n6 to cheer camp every year away for\n7 different -- for a period of days previously\n8 and had done that in previous years, that's\n9 not a change, is it?\n10 MR. CLAYTON: Is that a\n11 hypothetical?\n12 MS. AGRICOLA: No. She's gone\n13 to cheer camp every year. It's\n14 required. You have to go.\n15 A. Required by whom?\n16 Q. If you're going to be on the\n17 cheerleading team.\n18 A. This is the first team she's been on.\n19 Q. She's been a cheer -- no, this is not\n20 the first cheer team she's been on.\n21 Are you making this assessment\n22 about her thriving based on the understanding\n23 that this is the first time she's ever been\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n103\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 on a cheerleading squad?\n2 A. In our community, there are cheer\n3 squads that meet one or two hours a week and\n4 cheer for peewee games. There's not a\n5 competitive cheer team for people her age.\n6 Q. Well, the UCA does cover all ages.\n7 A. Correct.\n8 Q. That's where she was selected as an\n9 all star, UCA. I was on it. That's why I\n10 know so much about it.\n11 A. Great. But I don't think that the\n12 UCA people work with the elementary students\n13 in our -- in our area. I don't think that\n14 those camps are offered like that.\n15 In fact, most of the camps are\n16 offered by our high school cheerleading\n17 squad. They're the ones that do that.\n18 Q. Okay.\n19 A. So I don't know -- I don't know\n20 whether she's been to an overnight, spend the\n21 night, two or three nights like a UCA camp\n22 prior to this year. I don't know that\n23 that -- I don't know that.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n104\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. But since you don't know that,\n2 do you see what I'm saying, it seems like\n3 kind of -- you're making a lot of --\n4 A. Well, I --\n5 Q. -- her thriving based on her going on\n6 this week-long camp, yet you don't know that\n7 she -- whether she's done that previously\n8 when she wasn't thriving or wasn't on the\n9 medication.\n10 A. Okay.\n11 Q. Right?\n12 A. Right.\n13 Q. Okay. And being selected as an all\n14 star really goes more towards her skill in\n15 the cheerleading department.\n16 Isn't that a fair statement?\n17 A. And that -- a key component of that\n18 is confidence.\n19 Q. Okay. Is that a scientific, medical\n20 opinion that confidence is required in order\n21 for her to be skilled at cheerleading?\n22 A. If you don't have confidence to throw\n23 your body up in the air and do a tumbling\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n105\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 pass, you're not going to do too well, are\n2 you, ma'am?\n3 Q. Right. But you can be confident in\n4 your ability as a cheerleader and not be\n5 confident in social settings.\n6 A. That's correct.\n7 Q. Right?\n8 Like, we also see pageant girls who\n9 are stunning and beautiful and confident in\n10 their abilities in the pageant world, but\n11 have the most, you know, very insecure, very\n12 low self-esteem outside of pageantry,\n13 correct?\n14 A. But she was also chosen as head as a\n15 seventh grader.\n16 Q. Okay.\n17 A. That means that there's some\n18 leadership skills that's involved in that --\n19 Q. Sure.\n20 A. -- that were recognized by her peer\n21 group.\n22 Q. Okay. So the fact that she's got\n23 leadership skills in cheerleading is part of\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n106\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 your determination that she has thrived in\n2 her father's care?\n3 A. She's thrived in this setting, yes.\n4 Q. Okay. She's been in other leadership\n5 positions previously when in both parents'\n6 care. Were you aware of that?\n7 A. I was not.\n8 Q. Okay. So would it be a fair\n9 statement that your conclusion about -- from\n10 the August 2025 visit about her being\n11 selected on the all star team for UCA and\n12 going to camp and being selected as a captain\n13 of the cheerleading squad, those are more --\n14 those are not scientific or medically-based\n15 conclusions, correct?\n16 A. They're not objective conclusions,\n17 that's correct.\n18 Q. Okay. Were you aware that she's also\n19 been intensely involved in dance previously?\n20 A. I was aware of that.\n21 Q. Okay. And were you aware that she\n22 thrived and was very skilled in dance prior\n23 to being placed on this medication?\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n107\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 A. Many cheerleaders are, ma'am.\n2 Q. Okay. And were you aware that she's\n3 very confident in her dance abilities prior\n4 to being put on any of these medications?\n5 A. I was not aware of that.\n6 Q. Have you had any other interactions\n7 with the Mother, Brittany Gilliland,\n8 regarding this child?\n9 A. Since this time, no, I have not.\n10 Q. So then you have met her mother,\n11 Brittany Gilliland, once on January -- I'm\n12 sorry -- on December 19th, 2024; is that\n13 correct?\n14 A. That is not correct. I had seen\n15 her --\n16 Q. Okay.\n17 A. -- as the custodial guardian for the\n18 Child at least one time in the past.\n19 Q. Okay. And when was that?\n20 A. I can't recall.\n21 Q. Was it one of the previous years\n22 while they were still married?\n23 A. Previous years.\nLANIER REPORTING, LLC 334.313.3480\n108\nDeposition of Dr. Eric Tyler 09/10/2025\n1 Q. Okay. And so just one other time in\n2 the past?\n3 A. Once or twice.\n4 Q. You haven't had any communication\n5 with the Mother since the December 19th, 2024\n6 appointment?\n7 A. I have not.\n8 Q. Okay. Is there anything else I have\n9 not asked you that you feel is relevant to\n10 this deposition?\n11 A. I think you've been very thorough.\n12 Q. Thank you. It is my job. And I\n13 would like to say I have not meant to offend\n14 you in any fashion. So if I have, I do\n15 apologize for that.\n16 I don't pretend to have any\n17 knowledge in the medical field whatsoever,\n18 and I'm just trying to make sure I'm doing my\n19 job.\n20 A.
