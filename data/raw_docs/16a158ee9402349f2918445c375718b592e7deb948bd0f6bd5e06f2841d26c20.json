A confirmation hearing in the Respondent’s bankruptcy case occurred on December\n11, 2024. Due to Respondent filing bankruptcy, Petitioner will not begin to see\nrepayment of Respondent’s debt to her for at least two years;\n3. Even more concerning, Respondent had contacted DHR at the time of filing for\nbankruptcy in September 2024, in order to garnish Petitioner’s wages so she would\nremain obligated to pay for the full amount of child support currently ordered, despite\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v.
