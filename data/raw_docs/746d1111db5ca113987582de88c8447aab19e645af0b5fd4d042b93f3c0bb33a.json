As recipient of this subpoena, you have the option to deliver or mail\nlegible copies of the documents or things to the party causing issuance of this subpoena, and the preparation of copies may be conditioned on the payment in\nadvance of the reasonable cost of making such copies. Other parties involved in this lawsuit have the right to be present at the time of the production or inspection.\nThe recipient of this subpoena has the right to object to the production or inspection at any time prior to the date of production or inspection set forth in this\nsubpoena. See Ala. R.Civ.P. 45(c) (2) (B), which is set out below.\nRule 45, Ala. R.Civ.P., Paragraphs (c) & (d)\n(c) Protection of person subject to subpoenas.\n(1) A party or an attorney responsible for the issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a\nperson subject to that subpoena. The court from which the subpoena was issued shall enforce this duty and impose upon the party or attorney in breach of this\nduty on appropriate sanction, which may include, but is not limited to, lost earnings and a reasonable attorney fee.\n(2) (A) A person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, document or tangible things, or inspection of premises\nneed not appear in person at the place of production or inspection unless commanded to appear for deposition, hearing or trial.\n(B) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this rule, a person commanded to produce and permit inspection and copying at any time before the time specified for\ncompliance may serve upon the party or attorney designed in the subpoena written objection to inspection or copying of any or all of the designated\nmaterials or of the premises. “Serve” as used herein means mailing to the party or attorney. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be\nentitled to inspect and copy the materials or inspect the premises except pursuant to an order of the court by which the subpoena was issued. If objection\nhas been made, the party serving the subpoena may, upon notice to the person commanded to produce, move at any time for an order to compel the\nproduction. Such an order to compel production shall protect any person who is not a party or an officer of a party from significant expenses resulting from\nthe inspection and copying commanded.\n(3) (A) On timely motion, the court by which a subpoena was issued shall quash or modify the subpoena if it\n(i) fails to allow reasonable time for compliance;\n(ii) requires a resident of this state who is not a party or an officer of a party to travel to a place more than one hundred (100) miles form the place where\nthat person resides, is employed or regularly transacts business in person, or requires a nonresident of this state who is not a party or an officer of a party\nto travel to a place within this state more than one hundred (100) miles from the place of service or, where separate from the place of service, more than\none hundred (100) miles from the place where that person is employed or regularly transacts business in person, except that, subject to the provision of\nclause (c)(3)(B)(iii) of this rule, such a person may in order to attend trial be commanded to travel from any such place within the state in which the trial is\nheld, or\n(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter and no exception or waiver applies, or\n(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.\n(B) If a subpoena\n(i) requires disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, or\n(ii) requires disclosure of an unretained expert’s opinion or information not describing specific events or occurrences in dispute and resulting from the\nexpert’s study made not at the request of any party, or\n(iii) requires a person who is not a party or an officer of a party to incur substantial expenses to travel more than 100 miles to attend trial, the court may, to\nprotect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or modify the subpoena or, if the party in whose behalf the subpoena is issued shows a\nsubstantial need for the testimony or material that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship and assures that the person to whom the subpoena is\naddressed will be reasonably compensated, the court may order appearance or production only upon specified conditions.\n(d) Duties in responding to subpoena.\n(1) A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize\nand label them to correspond with the categories in the demand.\n(2) When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall\nbe made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced that is sufficient to\nenable the demanding party to contest the claim.\n(3) If a subpoena does not specify the form or forms for producing electronically stored information, a person responding to a subpoena must produce the\ninformation in a form or forms in which the person ordinarily maintains it or in a form or forms that are reasonably usable.\n(4) A person responding to a subpoena need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.\n(5) A person responding to a subpoena need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources the person identifies to the requesting\nparty as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or to quash, the person from whom discovery is sought\nmust show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order\ndiscovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limitations of Rule 26(b)(2)(B). The court may specify conditions\nregarding the production of the discovery.\n(6) If information is produced in discovery that is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person or party making the\nclaim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or\ndestroy the specified information and any copies it has and may not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved. Any party or the producing\nperson may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim. If the receiving party disclosed the information before\nbeing notified, it must take reasonable steps to retrieve it. The person who produced the information must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.\nState of Alabama ORDER TO APPEAR Case Number:\nUnified Judicial System\n(SUBPOENA) 70-DR-2023-900051.01\nForm C-13 (front) Rev. 4/18\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF TALLAPOOSA - ALEX CITY COUNTY, ALABAMA\nState of Alabama\nMunicipality of ___________________________________________________________________________________\nCHRISTOPHER BLAINE MCGREGOR V.
