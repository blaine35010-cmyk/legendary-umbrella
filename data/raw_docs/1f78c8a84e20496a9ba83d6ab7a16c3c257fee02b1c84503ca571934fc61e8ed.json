The minor child, namely, A.K.M.,dob, 05/24/2012, has been seeing a counselor\nnamed Deidre Leslie at CAC (Children’s Advocacy Center) for approximately three\n(3) years;\n2. That due to funding, Deidre Leslie’s counseling services were eliminated and she is\nnow with Prevail Counseling and Wellness;\n3. That due to the fact the minor child is under the age of 14, a new consent form must\nbe signed by both parents;\n4. That as of this date, the Mother has not signed as she wants a counselor they both\nagree on;\n5. That A.K.M. has established a relationship with Deidre Leslie and is very comfortable\ntalking with her;\n6. That the Father feels to change counselors at this point would be starting over for the\nminor child and feels that this might not be the best choice for the child’s mental\nhealth well being;\nWHEREFORE, the premises considered, the Father requests this Court order the Mother to sign\nthe consent form that she has been sent in order for the minor child to continue her counseling sessions\nwith Deidre Leslie.\nDOCUMENT 400\nRespectfully submitted on this the 30th day of October, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, Alabama 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (Facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing in the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 30th day of October, 2025.\nBarbara H.
