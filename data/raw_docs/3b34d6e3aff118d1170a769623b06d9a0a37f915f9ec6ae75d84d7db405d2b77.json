DR-2023-900051.01\nBRITTANY MICHELLE GILLILAND )\nDEFENDANT/PETITIONER )\nMOTION FOR CONTEMPT\nComes now the Plaintiff/Respondent, Christopher Blaine McGregor, by and through his\nattorney, Dianne James Davis, and files this Motion for Contempt and would state as follows:\n1. That at 10:59 am this morning, Defendant’s counsel sent an email that the Defendant\nwould be coming to pick up the minor child A.K., dob, 05-24-2012, (age 13) at 1:00\npm today for visitation. Copy attached as Exhibit “A”. That at 10:59 am was the\nfirst that Counsel knew the Mother intended to attempt to exercise visitation\nwith the minor child, A.K.\n2. That per the Order of November 6, 2024, the Court received testimony from the\nminor child, (A.K.), concerning her current relationship with the Mother and her\nreasons for not abiding by the court-ordered visitation as laid out in the divorce\ndecree. Following the in camera interview, counsel for both Parties, along with the\nCourt, agreed that proceeding with the show cause hearing was not appropriate at this\ntime. This Order further ordered reunification of the minor child and mother through\ntherapy and family dinners.\n3. That on June 2, 2025, the Mother has the minor child., B.M. and wanted to keep him\neven though it was not her week and an agreement was reached for summer visitation\nfor ONLY this minor child, not for the minor child, A.K. A copy of the email is\nattached as Exhibit B.\n4. That the Mother has not made a demand for the minor child, A.K. (age 13) to\ncome to her house for summer visitation until now and this is the final week of\nDOCUMENT 205\nsummer visitation which was to begin July 13, 2025, for Bennett. That the\nMother is aware the Father is out of town for work and the minor child is staying with\nher grandmother.\n5. That the Temporary Order entered by this Court on April 14, 2025, modified the\nvisitation of the minor child, B.M. and ordered family dinners with both children to\nresume and the Mother has missed several Sunday dinners with the children.\n6. That on June 18, 2025, an Order was entered by this Court that stated: Modification\nof child support is held pending final hearing. The Father is expected and remains\nordered to comply with the custody and visitation schedule set forth in the\nfinal order.\n7. That by demanding the minor child, A.K. to go to the Mother’s home for summer\nvisitation will only hurt the relationship that the Mother declares she wishes to fix.\nThat the Father texted the child immediately upon being contacted by Counsel\nregarding visitation with her mother and her response was “No!! Please I’m scared,\nwhy is this starting now. I don’t wanna go I’m gonna have a nervous\nbreakdown if I have to go”. A copy is attached as Exhibit “C”.\nWherefore, the premises considered, the Father is requesting this Court enter an Order to\ndeny the mother visitation with A.K. other than the Family Dinners as set out in other orders of\nthis Court and find her in Contempt for attempting to take the child knowing the Father is out of\ntown. That the issue of any visitation be addressed at the Final Hearing which is set for\nSeptember 11, 2025.\nRespectfully submitted on this the 14th day of July, 2025.\n/s/Dianne James Davis\nDianne James Davis (DAV007)\nAttorney for Plaintiff/Father\n107 Main Street\nAlexander City, Alabama 35010\n(256) 392-3172\n(256) 392-3578 (Facsimile)\ndianne@diannedavislaw.com\nDOCUMENT 205\nCertificate of Service\nI hereby certify that I have served a copy of the foregoing upon the following via\nelectronic filing in the AlaCourt E-File System and/or by placing a copy of same, properly\naddressed and postage paid in the U.S. Mail on this the 14th day of July, 2025.\nBarbara H.

Gilliland Summer Visitation\nAII.-\nIt appears that Blaine has not been allowing Brittany to exercise visitation with AK but is allowing\nBennett to visit. As you all are aware, the Judge's order was very clear for summer visits, and it is not\noptional for Blaine to unilaterally withhold AK. Brittany will be coming today at l:oopm to pick up\nAK for her visitation with her mother. Please let us know where AK is currently staying, as glaine is\nout of tornm and we are aware she is staying at another person's house. Please let ui kn-ow what\naddress she is located at. AK will be returned on the zoth along with Bennett unless AK wishes to\nreturn sooner, in which case AK will be returned no sooner than this Wednesday.

Blaine is quite upset that\nBrittany has turned everything around as she knew she was to have Bennett home this\nmorning. She refuses to tell Blaine what home day care she has him in while she is at\nwork.\nPer the Order the first full week of June would begin June 6th.\nEven though there was no agreement for Brittany to keep Bennett this week, after talking with\n5th.\nBlaine, Bennett can stay and return home at 5:00 pm on Friday June Her 2nd week of June\nwould be Friday, June 20th at 6:00 to Friday, June 27th at 6:00.\nHer first week of July would be from Friday, June 27th at 5:00 pm to Friday, July 4th at 5:00\npm.\nHer 2nd week of July would be Sunday July 13th at 6:00 pm to Sunday July 20th at 6:00 pm\nas Bennett will be at the beach for MK's cheer camp.
