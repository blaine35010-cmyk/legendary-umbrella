Agricola, with the law firm of Agricola Law, LLC, and\nhereby files a Renewed Motion for Pendente Lite Relief. In support thereof, Mother states as\nfollows:\n1. Parties appeared before this Honorable Court for a Show Cause Hearing on July 31,\n2024 and announced an agreement on record regarding the terms for reunification\ntherapy for the Minor Child A.K. and Mother, co-parenting, family dinners, and joint\ncounselling sessions;\n2. This Honorable Court issued an order on November 6, 2024 [Doc. 66] which ordered\nthe Parties to initiate reunification therapy with Minor Child A.K., effective\nimmediately;\n3. Paragraph four of this Court’s Order states, in part, “If Father ever impedes upon these\ncounselling sessions, causes A.K. to miss the sessions, or allows A.K. to miss these\nsessions, for any reason other than emergency, this will be considered willful contempt\nof this Court’s order”;\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v. Christopher Blaine McGregor\nCircuit Court of Tallapoosa County, Alabama\nCase No.: CL-2024-0597\nRenewed Motion for PDL Relief\nPage 1 of 4\nDOCUMENT 84\n4. Mother scheduled her first appointment with Kelly Turner, a reunification therapist,\nand informed Father of the date. After scheduling this appointment, Father proceeded\nto schedule an appointment for A.K. to be evaluated for possible ADHD on the date of\nthe reunification therapy. Then, Father contacted Kelly Turner and informed her that\nthe appointment would need to be rescheduled due to this appointment. See Exhibit A,\nFather’s messages in a group text with Mother and Kelly Turner. Father also personally\ntexted Mother incorrectly claiming that he had scheduled his appointment for A.K. first,\ndespite this not being the case. Further, per the Court’s order, reunification therapy\ntakes precedence over any prior commitment due to the circumstances regarding this\npresent action, specifically Father’s severe parental alienation of A.K.;\n5. Further, this Order also establishes weekly family dinners between the Parties and\nMinor Children. The Parties engaged in their first weekly dinner, in which Father was\npurposefully antagonizing and berating Mother and stating, in front of Minor Children\nincluding A.K., that Mother was “forcing” A.K. to attend the dinner and disrupting\nA.K.’s schedule. Father began raising his voice and A.K. became distressed and began\nto berate Mother as well, stating that Mother was the reason A.K. was performing\npoorly in school. The undersigned has recordings of this dinner for the Court’s review.\nFather complied with the court-ordered dinner, though it is clear he is trying to further\nharm Mother’s relationship with A.K. Father’s behavior was so horrendous that after\nhe left with the Children, several workers employed at the restaurant approached\nMother to console her after witnessing the ordeal. Mother filed a police report to\ndocument this incident. See Exhibit B, the incident report;\nBrittany Michelle Gilliland v. Christopher Blaine McGregor\nCircuit Court of Tallapoosa County, Alabama\nCase No.: CL-2024-0597\nRenewed Motion for PDL Relief\nPage 2 of 4\nDOCUMENT 84\n6. Father continues to consistently interfere with Mother’s ability to follow this Court’s\nOrder and alienate Mother from A.K., despite every good-faith attempt Mother has\ntaken that showcases her willingness to rekindle her relationship with A.K.;\n7. Further, Father has contacted DHR and notified Mother’s employer that her wages will\nbe garnished due to not paying child support. However, Father has filed for bankruptcy\nin an effort to avoid his required $2,000.00 a month equity payment to Mother, which\nhas greatly reduced her income making her unable to pay child support. Thus child\nsupport is due to be paused until Father resumes his $2,000.00 equity payments to\nMother;\n8. Father is in willful contempt of this Court’s Order and Mother has incurred attorney’s\nfees due to Father’s continued contempt and forced to take the present action.\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Mother respectfully requests that the\nCourt GRANT the following relief:\n1. GRANT Mother’s motion for pendente lite relief.\n2. Find Father in contempt of this Honorable Court’s Order.\n3. Impose appropriate sanctions to Father to compel compliance with the Order.\n4. Temporarily pause child support.\n5. ORDER that Father pay Mother’s attorney’s fees as a result of Father’s contempt.\n6. GRANT to Mother such other and further relief as the Court deems just, proper,\nand to which in equity and good conscience she may be entitled.\n9.
