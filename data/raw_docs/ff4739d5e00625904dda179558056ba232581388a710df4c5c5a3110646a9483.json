First, I would suggest that the\nreference to a Wednesday dinner was just that, a suggestion. The main idea was to\nhave at least one meal per week, and Sunday seems to be the more practical as there\nis less possibility of conflict with other things on the agenda of A.K., Mr. McGregor, or\nyour client. Secondly, the reunification therapy must take into consideration A.K.’s\nactivities. Your client’s position, that no matter how much it interferes with her daily\nschedule that reunification counseling must happen, is unreasonable. As I see it, as\nimportant as said counseling might be, we must take other matters into consideration\nwhen scheduling said counseling, including the activities of A.K, as well as the work\nschedules in order to avoid creating more stress among all parties. And last, the\nreunification therapy is due to the fact that your client physically abused A.K. That\nabuse, alone, has created the problem. We were willing to use our insurance if\ninsurance would pay, but it will not. Therefore, the cost of the reunification therapy\nshould be paid by your client.\nAs referenced in an earlier letter, I will be more than happy to present our\nproposed order, and you can do so from your position.\nSincerely,\nTOM F. YOUNG, JR.\nTFY/cc",
