I had called AK at 8:10 and\nshe said she was in the bath.\n5/9/2024 4:38 PM (Viewed 5/9/2024 4:56 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nThese scenarios you like to create are not true and this is\nwhy things are recorded so that you can’t say the opposite.\nScreaming that I called Jeannie white trash and then saying I\nwas going to burn in hell in front of AK is not healthy.\nI just think it’s really strange and odd that we can go to dinner\nwhen you haven’t heard from my lawyers. Now that you have\nbeen served with the contempts and the appeal, I haven’t\nbeen able to be around Addie Kate since March 27th. That\nwas the last day we went to dinner because that following\nweek you got Thomas Radneys letter.\n5/9/2024 4:49 PM (Viewed 5/9/2024 4:56 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nAll this text is supposed to be about is coparenting. For the\nnext 14 years we will have to communicate and arrange things\nlike this. When you refuse is when the law gets involved. They\nwouldn’t have went over there if they had thought it wasn’t\nneeded. I asked.\n5/9/2024 5:00 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nNone of this is true. I knew what Thomas filed the weekend\ndrove AK all the way to Montgomery so you could go\n277\nshopping with her & do dinner with the kids. We also had\ndinner at the Mexican several times after your filing.\nThe reason I stopped is because you come unhinged. You act\nout, get in my car, refuse to get out, have to call the police\netc… I’m not putting myself in that position anymore.\nAs always AKs always welcome to go with you. I don’t keep her\nfrom you.\n5/9/2024 5:01 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nSo the answer to your question is no. I have plans for\ntomorrow.

Go back in\nour texts and reread how you have responded and attacked if\nsomething wasn’t going your way.\nIt’s very sad that instead of coparenting, you can’t just clearly\ncommunicate.

We have no need to talk other\nthan to communicate to each other needs or activities for the\nchildren.\nI have never withheld information from you. You have\nnumerous times.

If you didn’t have malicious\nreasoning behind it, then you would have said “I’ve got to\nreschedule the meeting because AKs conference is that same\ntime” Even after I messaged you back with I could still go\nbecause we didn’t have to be together when we talked to Mrs\nStallworth, there was another opportunity you could have said\n“well I’m sure you want to hear AKs student led conference.\nIt’s at the same time”\n5/17/2024 4:31 PM (Viewed 5/17/2024 5:10 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nI’m not texting anymore but I feel I need to make these points\nafter what you just texted.\nPlease make sure Bennett’s game is with him.

If the kids wanted to stay\nwith you they could but I’m not going to force them.\nIn my opinion the point of you getting extra time in the\nsummer is to spend the extra time with the kids.

I also understand that making\nthem go to a strangers place or somewhere other than their\nhome just because it’s your time doesn’t make sense or seem\nlike the best decision for the kids.\nI offered… the decision was yours… I want offer again.\n6/3/2024 12:44 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nBtw- Tom is my lawyer.. you know that because he’s been in\ntouch with your lawyer.\nBut again… I try to work directly with you instead of running to\nthe lawyers & police for everything\n6/3/2024 12:51 PM (Viewed 6/3/2024 12:54 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nNo what’s awful is having Bennett crying because he didn’t\nwant to stay with Anthony but I had to force him to go there\nthat morning since you pitched a fit.

Keeping Bennett from the beach so you can have him at\nyour work for 8 hours or leaving him with someone else while\nyou work isn’t doing what’s best for him IMO.

We can figure out the day and time that works\nwith everyone’s schedules and kids.\nAs far as the holiday schedule, I have always been very flexible\nwith you, especially days that are not outlined in the order.\nIt’s only productive, healthy and positive when you coparent\ntogether. I’ve stressed this for a whole year. You take you and\n501\nme out of the equation and decisions are always about and\nfor the kids.

Having overnight\ncompany at your home, taking Bennett to Clanton to spend\nthe night at his home, staying in Dadeville in a 1 bedroom\ntrailer at the lake, & sharing a bed with our son is a little\ndifferent.\nI don’t care what you do but would Bradley like it if another\nman was sleeping in the bed with Caitlin & his 2 girls?

The 2 most important points to me are\nBennett being in AC on school nights & allowing AK & you\nto continue working on y’all’s relationship without it being\nforced. Time heals everything & we’ve made a lot of progress\nover the past few weeks in all areas but IMO especially around\nAK. I’m not having to literally force her to answer your calls\netc… She’s 13… if we stay down the path the we had been on\nfor 2 years… she would have aged out of the family court &\nnothing would have been any better between y’all.\n770\nI know you miss AK Brittany, that’s why I try my best to get\ntogether once a week so you can see her. We can sit down &\ncontinue to blame each other all day but Britt you are literally\nthe only person that can heal y’all’s problems & I’ll support in\nany way I can as long as AKs comfortable & it’s not causing\nturmoil for her.\nWe’ve all been through a lot over the last two years, but AK\nhas especially been through more than any of us. It’s time to\nlet her enjoy being a 13-year-old without all the stress as you\ntwo continue to work on y’all’s relationship naturally.\n4/2/2025 5:17 PM (Viewed 4/2/2025 5:23 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nI completely agree.

I’ve told\nyou the 2 most important things for me & those come from\nhaving the kids best interest in mind.\n771\nAKs been very clear how she feels about the forced methods\nwe’ve done over the last 2 years. I don’t understand your\nview point on this & thats fine but I would choose my kids\nhappiness every single time over & over again so its hard for\nme to understand. It’s all I want in my life is for our kids to be\nsuccessful, happy, & healthy. AK has told us both she’s not\nready for that & that’s why I suggested continuing to work on\nthis more natural path we’ve been on for the last few weeks.\nWe’re going to look up & she’s going to be off at college… I\nknow what my relationship with her will look like… You have\nto start putting her happiness & best interests first & give her\nopinions some consideration if you truly want things to be\ndifferent.\nIf that’s the route you’re wanting to continue to go down then\nI suggest we split a court appointed GAL & after the GAL does\nhome studies etc… make a recommendation to the judge\naround best interest of our kids… That way we continue to\nwork on our co-parenting because it gets tiring being painted\nas villain for advocating for the kids best interest. We have\ndifferent opinions of what that is & if we get a GAL I feel like it\nwould take that part out of it.\n4/2/2025 5:45 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nBut guess I’ll see you in the morning\n4/2/2025 7:54 PM (Viewed 4/2/2025 8:01 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nCan you call when y’all get home?\n4/2/2025 8:44 PM (Read 4/2/2025 9:40 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nWhat do you mean?

Based on\nconsistent feedback from his teacher, he’s been struggling in\nthe classroom with focus, staying seated, following directions,\nand keeping his hands to himself. While he is bright and eager\nto participate, these challenges are making it harder for him to\nbe successful.\nTeacher Feedback & Incidents\n• Aug 14: Teacher reported Bennett avoided classwork by\ndrawing instead of completing his IXL diagnostic.\n• Aug 19: Took the teacher’s pointer and spanked himself.\n1012\n• Aug 20: Attempted to crawl into another student’s bathroom\nstall; teacher placed him “on a step” (part of the classroom\nbehavior system).\n• Aug 22: Talked and laughed during a lockdown drill,\ndisrupting the procedure.\n• Aug 25: Teacher reported he’s “doing okay” but still very\nenergetic, requires frequent redirection, and struggles with\nkeeping hands to himself.\n• Aug 26: Energetic and talkative, distracted peers, though he\ndid well in math and eagerly shared ideas.\n• Aug 27: Refused to complete work, laid his head down on his\ndesk, and missed instruction time despite prompts. Bennett\nsaid his head was hurting.\nStrengths\n• Friendly, social, and described by his teacher as “energetic\nand a great friend.”\n• Eager to participate and share ideas, especially in math.\n• Wants to do well and responds positively at times to\nencouragement.\nChallenges\n• Difficulty with focus and completing tasks.\n• Impulsivity (touching objects, distracting peers, bathroom\nincident).\n• Trouble following directions the first time.\n• Disruptions during structured routines (lockdown drill,\nclassroom work).\n• Occasional refusal or inability to focus and complete work.\nActions I’ve Taken\n• Removed TV/iPad privileges and tied them to positive\nbehavior and schoolwork completion.\n• Established an earlier bedtime.\n• Offered to sit in the classroom or lobby if needed.\n• Asked the teacher to call me during incidents so I can\nintervene directly.\n• Scheduled ADHD testing and raised the possibility of\nprofessional evaluation to get clarity and the right support.\nTeachers also agrees that it’s time to explore this as well.\nActions Taken by Teacher\n• Provided daily updates on behavior and incidents.\n• Implemented classroom strategies such as breaking tasks\ninto smaller chunks, providing movement breaks, and using\nvisual checklists.\n• Reinforced home expectations (Dojo points, behavior-linked\nrewards).\n• Explained the classroom behavior system (“steps”).\n1013\n• Expressed willingness to support the ADHD evaluation\nprocess by completing paperwork.\nBennett has many strengths, but his challenges with focus,\nimpulsivity, and behavior are impacting his success in school.\nBoth his teacher and I have been consistently addressing\nthese issues with structure, communication, and adjustments\nat home and school. Given the ongoing difficulties, the ADHD\ntesting will provide the professional evaluation needed so we\ncan make the best plan to support him both at school and at\nhome.

I said so when you\ntexted a few weeks ago you were going to get him tested.\nI do however think before automatically getting him placed on\nall types of medication that he needs a good evaluation from\na specialist. I can ask Kandice who she would recommend\nbecause she works with ADHD/ADD kids all day at her clinic.\nI also would like to both work together in helping Bennett as\nmuch as we can at home. His diet, caffeine intake, sleep and\nscreen time ALL impact the behavior. Yes, I’m not a physician\nbut even Dr Tauro discussed screen time, sleep and caffeine\n(also all the apple juice AK drank) when Addie Kate had\ntrouble concentrating and staying engaged in Mrs Darks\nclassroom.\nIt’s just sensible to try everything else first and meds as a last\nresort.\nLet me know what you think\n9/24/2025 6:59 PM (Read 9/24/2025 7:20 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nBrittany I’m not interested in Kandices opinion, as I don’t\nknow her & you’ve know her about a year. We’ve known our\n1047\npediatrician for 38 years & they’ve treated our kids for 13\nyears.\nI’ve sent you what I’m doing at my house & I’m working\ndirectly with the school in that approach.\nIt’s not a choice- I’ve read & read on this.. Hyperactivity is\na core symptom of ADHD, it makes it difficult to control\nbehavior and focus. Bennett doesn’t choose to be hyperactive.\nBennett doesn’t learn from mistakes in the same way other\nchildren do. It’s a core symptom of ADHD.\nYou do realize that ADHD is a neuro/brain developmental\ndisorder. Willpower alone is not enough to control symptoms.\nWhen you have ADHD there is a difference in how your brain\ndevelops and functions in the front part of the brain. That’s\nthe part of the brain that affects attention & impulse control.\nThis is why he makes impulse decisions time after time and\ndoesn’t learn from his mistakes.\nAnd to be clear, medication is not a cure there is no cure for\nADHD. Is something that Ben was struggle with and live with\nfor the rest of his life is our job as his parents to give him\nthe tools necessary to be able to succeed and start building\nthe blocks and & foundation for his future education, take\nit from someone who lived it & continues to live with it. My\nparents didn’t have the opportunity that we have to provide\nfor our kids. As you know it wasn’t until middle school & that’s\ntoo late. I still struggle because I don’t have the fundamental\nbuilding blocks that I should’ve developed in education as\na child. Look at Addie Kate we waited too long to provide\nher with the tools she needed. She will continue to struggle\nuntil she develops that foundation that she’s going to need to\ncontinue to build on top of for her future education.\nIt takes medication & home intervention. Neither is a cure, but\nhe’s best chance at success is both. After medication most\nkids see an 80% improvement without any other intervention.\nBennett is a brilliant kid! We both know how smart he is. We\ncan’t let him slowly slip away & fall behind, that’s negligence\non our part.\nI know we are different & that’s ok, but my heart was shattered\nwhen I seen the situation at the school today. He’s been\nexcluded from his peers in the classroom. He’s been put\nagainst a brick wall. He’s confined to that space with excessive\namounts of energy with nowhere to use. Think of it as being\n1048\nput in a cage and having so much energy you don’t know\nwhat you’re gonna do with. His legs are so busy they have\nliterally rubbed paint off a brick wall. Look at the pictures\nBrittany, we don’t have time to mess around here. This is not\nabout me and you this is about our son. This isn’t about court.\nThis ain’t about games. This isn’t about anything other than\nwe owe this to him because he is suffering the consequences.\nI’ll leave you with 58% of kids who have ADHD that go\nunmediated don’t complete high school & a 95% chance of\nnot completing college.\nPlease let me know if you agree with making Bennett an apt\nwith Dr. Tyler. We chose him 13 years ago because we trusted\nhim!\n9/24/2025 7:21 PM (Read 9/24/2025 7:21 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nAnd please tell me about the visit & conference you had at\nAKs school that you failed to include or inform me about.

Brittany this is exactly why one of us\nhave to have full decision making on education & medical. I’ve\nasked you a very important question & received no response\nor answer that facilitate a solution for our son. You do realize\nhe has in school suspension tomorrow because he’s on his\nfourth step he got in school suspension Brittany because his\nfeet rubbed against the wall and rubbed the paint off the wall\nand he said at his desk after he completed his work and cut\npaper up. He’s not disrespectful. He’s not a bad kid Brittany\nwe have to do something. I can’t keep waiting around on you.\n9/24/2025 8:06 PM (Viewed 9/24/2025 8:26 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nNo I gave you a plan that is in the best interest of Bennett. He\nneeds to be tested but by a specialist. I said Kandice works\nwith ADHD/ADD children all day and could give a great\nsuggestion of someone that can provide testing and paths\n1049\nwe can take together to ensure Bennett succeeds not only\nacademically but in all aspects.\nYou wanted to belittle my input because my approach is\ndifferent than yours. You always want control and when you\ndon’t have it you resort to saying you will take away my rights\nas a parent. Read the 2nd sentence of your last paragraph. As\nyou’ve always said since 2020 when we had an argument that\nyou would make sure you had sole custody of the kids. I can\nprovide that screenshot if you need a reference.\nNo I didn’t know he had school suspension because you did\nnot share that information until after my initial response to\nyou.\nBennett is an amazing kid. He LIGHTS UP when he’s shown\nsomething new. He learns very quickly and is a sponge. When\nwe go over his sight words he knows almost every single one.\nSome hiccups. But he’s a smart kid.\nIt’s very sad that I am telling you the screen time, caffeine,\nsleep schedule and diet needs to be altered as well and\ninstead of saying you will make sure those needs are met\nyou want to argue. Ask any pediatrician. The research is\nthere. No I am not saying that is a cure all. I never made that\ninsinuation but IT HELPS. As a parent you should want to take\nANY necessary steps especially ones you can control at home\nto benefit your child. I didn’t just say you. I said we both need\nto do these things.\nAlso, my phone call just now with Bennett is just that. Mine\nand his. As I said on the phone when you wanted to take over\nthe conversation rudely say “you’re not going to ask Bennett\nwhat happened at school today!?” Like I replied no I’m not\ngoing to start that type of conversation with him at 8:00 at\nnight. He needs rest. That wasn’t fair to him to want to start\nsomething at this time of night and then you yelling back\n“well that’s not how I parent and we can just be different!!”\nThis is just really sad. It’s really really heartbreaking.\nI do not want another text from you tonight. I said my peace\nafter the book you just typed full of criticism and mockery.\n9/24/2025 8:44 PM (Read 9/24/2025 8:55 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nI’ll move forward with getting him tested.

Now that I’ve made them, you are stating you\nare going to pursue testing YOUR way without allowing me\nthe option to be present and involved in helping our child.\nIt is disturbing, it is sad. It’s really really sad. This whole text\nthread was pointless given your last text was just proving you\nwere going to do whatever you wanted to do without my\ninput regardless of what it was.\n9/24/2025 9:04 PM (Read 9/24/2025 9:07 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nWe picked our kids doctor together 13 years ago. Just because\nyou’ve abused our daughter and you acted out in the office\ndoesn’t mean he was not a neutral doctor that has no impact\non his ability to provide service to our children not going\nback-and-forth with you on this anymore. Have a good night.\n9/24/2025 9:08 PM\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nMessage was edited 9/24/2025 9:10 PM\nRemember when you took AK in but never followed up with\nthe school? Our pediatricians were qualified, then right??? but\nbecause you want debunk the pediatrician office because of\nhow you acted….they’re not qualified anymore.

Did you already complete and fax your assignment\ninto the office?\nDr. Tyler has completed reviewing the assessments, turned\nin by Bennetts, teachers and administrators. L. Russell from\npediatrics called today and they have an opening for October\n2 at 7:45 AM.\nI took the appointment so we don’t have to wait 6-8 weeks\nto start testing. Dr Tyler can complete his assessment and\nafter his assessment we can decide to move forward with\nmedication or if we don’t agree, it might be something that\nwe have to discuss in court. I’m hopeful that after Dr. Tyler’s\nassessment, we can agree to move forward & provide our son\nwith the tools he needs to be successful.\nIf we don’t agree then the assessment will be complete & I’ll\nhold off on medication until we get clarity from the court.\nAgain, I’m hopeful we can come to a decision afterwards so\nthe courts don’t have to tell us how to parent our children.\n1052\nThe cost is around $200-$300, do you think you could split it?\nIf not, I understand & I’ll figure it out.\n9/25/2025 5:07 PM (Read 9/25/2025 5:23 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nAre you picking Bennett up from the house tomorrow?\n9/25/2025 6:57 PM (Viewed 9/25/2025 7:16 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nI went back through all messages from the past few weeks and\ndo not see anything regarding an assignment. Please send me\nthe information so I can do my part.\nI also did not get an appointment notification for Bennett like I\nusually get when an appt has been made.\nAs I stated last night, Bennett needs to see a specialist….not\na pediatrician. I repeated myself several times last night. I’m\nnot sure why you even texted me when you went ahead and\ndid whatever you wanted to do in regards to Bennett’s best\ninterest.\nI will pick up Bennett tomorrow from school.\n9/25/2025 6:57 PM (Viewed 9/25/2025 7:16 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nPlease have Bennett call me\n1053\n9/25/2025 7:17 PM (Read 9/25/2025 7:18 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nI sent it on 8/27\n9/25/2025 7:25 PM\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nOk I didn’t see the attachment when I scrolled up.\nPlease have Bennett call\n9/25/2025 7:35 PM (Read 9/25/2025 7:53 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nYou’re absolutely right! When our kids need something, I move\nswiftly & would move mountains for them. Have you done\nanything since the discussion first started Have you done any\nresearch on a specialist? What specialist do you recommend?\nI’m going to add that you took AK to our pediatric office for\nADHD. It’s documented. I sent you the proof last night. Can\nyou explain what’s changed? You trusted that office for 13\nyears. You have to put your pride aside & make decisions in\nthe best interest of the child.\n1054\nYou can’t even get off work to make it to the kids events. How\nare you going to take off every 2 weeks for 2 months for\nfollow up because that’s what has to happen when they start\nmedication.\nI’m not arguing about it anymore. Fill the form out & fax it in\nto the PAAC office if you want to be included. I’ve informed\nyou of the appointment date & time. I told you that I’ll have\nhim tested & won’t start any medication until we can come to\na resolution by either open discussion & dialogue or as a last\nresort the court.\nWhat’s wrong with going to the appointment to get him\ntested? There is nothing to lose but time he’s not going to get\nback.\nI’ve also asked you 3 times to provide the details behind your\nmeeting at AKs school. The meeting you came to AC for that\nwas on AKs first home game, why didn’t you come to her\ngame being you were in AC? I shared with you when I met\nwith Mrs Powell.\n9/25/2025 8:03 PM (Read 9/25/2025 8:03 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nBennett asleep\n9/25/2025 8:29 PM (Viewed 9/25/2025 8:38 PM)\nBrittany Gilliland new (3349917778)\nI’ve asked you now this is my third time to please let Bennett\ncall me.\nI’m not entertaining your tantrums and high conflict approach.\nThis is exhausting trying to request that you even attempt to\ncoparent when it’s something you feel like you don’t have\n100% control over. This is very black and white given your\ntexts.\nAs I keep repeating myself, I feel as though it’s in the best\ninterest of Bennett to see a board certified specialist. Why are\nyou so against that? A parent should always want the very\nbest for your child. I’ve never said anything negative about\nDr Tyler or I wouldn’t have requested the kids see him for\n1055\ntheir wellness visits instead of Dr Tauro who I think is also a\nfantastic pediatrician. I don’t have to address why the request\nwas necessary but if needed, we will discuss in court on the\n17th.\nYou are right you won’t even try to come together to come\nup with the best possible solution to help Bennett excel and\nachieve his full potential because you want to undermine\nand belittle my input. So what was your point exactly in\neven messaging me? For show? It’s just really sad and\nheartbreaking we will have to address all of this come October\n17th in a courtroom.\nThis is my LAST response to you on this issue.\n9/25/2025 8:38 PM (Read 9/25/2025 8:38 PM)\nBlaine McGregor iPhone 16 (blainemcgregor@icloud.com)\nI told you he was asleep.
